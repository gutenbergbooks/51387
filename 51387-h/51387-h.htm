<h2 id="NOTE_BY_THE_EDITOR">NOTE BY THE EDITOR</h2>

<p>These pages have been put together under pressure of the
desirability of placing their contents without further delay in
the hands of a public virtually limited to Regimental members
past and present, their relatives and friends. They do not aim
higher than setting on record the unvarnished chronicles of
several generations of volunteers who have never yielded place
to any in their pride and love of regiment.</p>

<p>Before the close of the last century the story of the Regiment’s
thirty years’ existence had been written by the officer who to-day
has been the right hand of the Editor in the task of bringing
the record down to the year of the War. The latter has to thank
Colonel Merrick for giving up much of his time to this object,
and for allowing a reprint of the earlier portion.</p>

<p>Captain Bell was good enough to make himself responsible for
the tale from the year 1909 to 1914. Major Kirkby has kindly
given his supervision in preparing certain tabular statements
which are found as appendices. Yet this book would never have
reached the printers’ hands but for the initiative shown by
Captain Davenport as regards the narrative of the first Battalion
in War. His achievement prompted the search for an author
who could and would do the same for the widely ranging story
of the movements of the second Battalion. Into this gap
stepped Major Benk&eacute; who, in a short space of time delivered the
completed task. It will be agreed that both these officers, aided
in some parts by collaborators, have produced a readable and
human account of those events of which they can speak at first
hand, made clearer by the excellent sketch maps which accompany
the narratives of operations.</p>

<p>To Major Duncan Lewis, the writer of those pages in which
the necessarily uneventful story of the third Battalion is found,
we express our indebtedness. Captain Doubleday is best fitted
to tell of the beneficent work of the Regimental Aid Fund,
and thanks may be expressed here on behalf of all those who
benefited by the activities of himself and his fellow-helpers.
In the very difficult task of compiling the lists of all ranks who
served in the Regiment during war time, we have to thank
Major Ramsbotham&mdash;the Adjutant&mdash;for his energy in this and,
indeed, in all matters connected with the needs of the Regiment.</p>

<p>Attention is directed to the statistics relating to the numbers
who served in the Regiment, and who were transfers, which will
be found at the end of Appendix VI.</p>

<p>Nine hundred and sixty-seven commissions were granted from
the ranks. The Dead number 1,227.

THE CIVIL SERVICE
RIFLE VOLUNTEERS</p>

<h2 id="PART_I_CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="medium">1859-1909<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span></h2>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">2</a>
This history, up to the year 1891, was written and published in that
year by Lieut. (now Lt.-Col.) Edward Merrick, C.S.R.V. He has brought
his narrative down to 1909 for the purpose of this volume.</p></div>

<p>For the purpose of tracing the first authentic record of Volunteers
connected with the Civil Service, it is necessary to call attention
to the raising of the Loyal Volunteers of London in 1798. About
that year, when we were at war with France and Spain, were
fighting in India, and almost all over the world, and the country
was denuded of troops, the rich citizens of London began to get
alarmed at their unprotected state, in the event of rebellion or
riot at home. They petitioned the King, and a charter was
granted, authorising the formation of armed associations in
London and the environs.</p>

<p>The “Loyal Volunteers of London,” as they were called, were
therefore raised to uphold the cause of the King and of order.
Their motto was “<i>Pro Rege et Patria</i>.”</p>

<p>Among the corps thus raised was that of the “Somerset
House Volunteers.” A picture of one of these gentlemen, as
copied from a book by T. Rowlandson, in the British Museum,
may now be seen in the Orderly Room at the Audit Office.</p>

<h3>Somerset House Volunteers, 1798.</h3>

<p>The Somerset House Volunteer Association consisted only of
two companies of light infantry, under the command of Walter
Sterling, Major Commandant. The Captains were J. Stewart
and W. Harrison. The corps was not to go out of the district
of Somerset House and St. Mary-le-Strand, but with its own
consent.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span></p>

<h3>Bank of England Volunteers, 1798.</h3>

<p>Among those who would have cause for anxiety at such a
period would naturally be the Governor and Directors of the
Bank of England, and certainly they showed great public spirit.
They headed a voluntary contribution to the revenue in this
year, with a subscription of &pound;200,000. They also raised from
their employ&eacute;s a corps of volunteers, 450 strong, to protect the
Bank.</p>

<p>This corps was under the command of Thomas Whitmore, and
Rowlandson tells us that it was presented with colours on
2nd September, 1799, by the lady of Samuel Thornton, Esq.,
Governor of the Bank of England, in Lord’s Ground, Marylebone.
A picture of this ceremonial, painted by Stoddart, is to be seen
now in the Bank.</p>

<p>These Loyal Volunteers of London were, however, entirely
swamped by the great volunteer movement, which swept throughout
the country in 1802, caused by the extensive preparations
then being made by Bonaparte to invade England.</p>

<h3>Volunteers of 1802.</h3>

<p>In this war-scare, which far exceeded in its intensity that
of 1859, 420,000 Volunteers were enrolled in a few months&mdash;many
more, in fact, than the Government could or ever did arm.</p>

<p>The Civil Service were represented in this body by two corps:
the Excise Corps, which in 1804 was 576 strong, under the
command of Lord George Seymour, and the Customs Corps,
about 300 strong.</p>

<p>In the same year (1804), the Bank of England had a corps of
433, under the command of William Manning, and a supplementary
corps of 122, under the command of Beeston Long.</p>

<p>Some of the records of the last-named corps are still in existence
in the Bank. From them we gather that the parades were
usually held at 7 or 8 a.m. The most notable period in their
history appears to have been in 1812, at the time of the assassination
of Mr. Percival in the House of Commons. In the state
of public alarm that followed this event, it was considered
necessary that the Bank Volunteers should be under arms to
guard the Bank, night and day.</p>

<h3>Disbandment.</h3>

<p>At the signing of the general treaty of peace in 1814, the joy
of the country at what it believed to be the conclusion of its
long and exhausting wars, was shown by the haste with which
the Volunteers were at once disbanded.</p>

<p>The Corps of the Civil Service shared with others in votes of
thanks passed to them by both Houses of Parliament, and letters
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
from the Commander-in-Chief (the Prince Regent) were received,
thanking each corps for its valuable services.</p>

<p>From the records already referred to, we find that a special
“march past” before the Lord Mayor, at the Mansion House,
brought the military duties of the Bank officials of that generation
to an end.</p>

<p>We now pass over a space of 45 years, during which the military
spirit of the Service may be said to have lain dormant, until we
approach the event with which the true interest of our story
begins, viz., the year 1859, and the birth of the Corps to which
we have the honour to belong.</p>

<p>To the Members of the Audit Office (now the Exchequer and
Audit Department), Somerset House, must, without doubt, be
assigned the honour of having founded the Civil Service Volunteer
Corps.</p>

<h3>General Meeting at Audit Office.</h3>

<p>The Volunteer Force of to-day, as everybody knows, sprang
into existence in the year 1859, and was occasioned by the
warlike attitude of the Emperor of the French and the blustering
threats of his generals. The notable circular of the Secretary of
State for War to the Lords Lieutenant, which called the Volunteers
into existence, was dated 12th May, 1859, and on the
18th May a meeting, which had been formally convened “to take
into consideration the formation of a Rifle Volunteer Corps from
the Members of the Civil Service,” was held at the Audit Office.
Mr. F. A. Hawker was the prime mover in this proceeding, and
he presided at the meeting.</p>

<p>Now, if everything had proceeded as satisfactorily as the
energetic and spirited action of these early pioneers deserved,
the “Civil Service” would have been one of the first Metropolitan
Corps formed, and its order of precedence would therefore
have been far in advance of what it ultimately became. But,
unfortunately, we have here another example of the old proverb,
“the more haste,” &amp;c., for, notwithstanding the circular of the
Secretary of State, the War Office were by no means ready to
respond with any degree of generosity to the crowds of enthusiastic
civilians who at once cried out on all sides to be armed.</p>

<p>The utmost conceded was that Volunteers should be allowed
in certain cases to <i>purchase</i> their own arms and equipment.</p>

<h3>First Attempts at Formation.</h3>

<p>The desire, however, of the Audit Office Meeting was that
special favour should be shown to Civil Servants, so it was
decided to express the views of the meeting in the following
letter, which was despatched, not to the War Office, but to the
Prime Minister himself, Earl Derby:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="author">“Audit Office, 20th May, 1859.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;I have the honour to transmit to your Lordship
a copy of the Resolutions passed at a meeting of gentlemen of the
Audit Office, held on the 18th instant to take into consideration
the formation of a Volunteer Rifle Corps from the members of the
Civil Service and I beg leave respectfully to request that your
Lordship will be pleased to cause me to be furnished with replies to
the Resolutions in question for the information of the gentlemen
in this office who have signified their desire to join a Civil Service
Rifle Corps.</p>

<p>“The junior members of the Civil Service being generally in the
receipt of small incomes, your Lordship will perceive that the only
difficulty in obtaining volunteers from the Civil Service is the
expense attending their outfit. I would therefore, venture more
particularly to draw your Lordship’s attention to the 3rd Resolution,
in which we request that the arms and accoutrements only may be
supplied to volunteers from the members of the Civil Service by Her
Majesty’s Government; <i>and as this is a question which affects nearly
the whole body of the Civil Service, who are anxious to enrol themselves
into a Volunteer Rifle Corps</i>, I trust that your Lordship will not
think us intrusive in asking you to take these Resolutions into your
favourable consideration.</p>

<p>“We hope your Lordship will pardon us if we have taken any
liberty in bringing this subject under your consideration, but as
Civil Servants of the Crown we are anxious that we should not be
behind others in the present movement in favour of the formation
of Volunteer Rifle Corps.</p>

<p class="author">“I have, &amp;c.,<br />
“<span class="smcap">F. A. Hawker</span>.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The reply to this letter came from the War Office, and affords
an admirable illustration of the amount of official support, which
the Volunteer movement received in its infancy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="author">“War Office, 31st May, 1859.</p>

<p>“Sir,&mdash;I am directed by Secretary Major-General Peel to acknowledge
the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, on the subject of
a Civil Service Volunteer Corps, which has been forwarded to this
office by Lord Derby.</p>

<p>“In reply, I am to inform you that the Government have decided
not to supply arms to Volunteer Corps, either by sale or otherwise;
and that General Peel does not consider the case of the gentlemen
on whose behalf your application has been made to be one in which
he can sanction a departure from the general rule.</p>

<p class="author">“I am, &amp;c.,<br />
“<span class="smcap">H. R. Drewry</span>.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus closed the first act in the attempt to form a Civil Service
Rifle Corps, for this snub appears to have had the effect of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
quenching the military ardour of the Auditors to such an extent
that several months elapsed before they recovered from it.</p>

<p>In October, however, roused by events going on around them,
they took heart once more, and returned to the charge. By this
time Government had partially thawed, under the influence of
the excitement throughout the country. Lord Ranelagh’s
Committee had sat at the War Office, and it had been decided
to issue arms to Volunteers at the lavish rate of one rifle to
every four men enrolled.</p>

<p>In answer, therefore, to a letter despatched to him by Mr.
Hawker, the Secretary of State for War stated, in a reply dated
7th November, 1859, that he would be happy to recommend
Her Majesty to accept any offer of the service of a Company or
Sub-division of Volunteers, which he might receive from Mr.
Hawker through the Lord-Lieutenant of the County.</p>

<h3>Audit Corps Formed.</h3>

<p>Forthwith, at a general meeting held in the Audit Office on
the 10th November, it was resolved, “That it was desirable that
a Sub-division of not less than forty effectives be at once formed
in the Audit Office, and that other departments be invited to
co-operate by raising Companies or Sub-divisions with the view
of promoting the formation of a Brigade.”</p>

<p>From this time forward enthusiasm and hard work were the
order of the day. A circular letter to other Government Departments
was issued, and the nucleus of the Corps was at once
formed by the immediate election of forty-six members of the
Audit Office.</p>

<p>In a few days the number of effective members enlisted had
reached seventy. Affairs were pushed on with great energy,
and on the 25th November, 1859, at half-past four in the afternoon,
the first drill of the Civil Service Volunteers was held in
Westminster Hall&mdash;one Sergeant Chace being the Instructor.</p>

<h3>Other Corps Formed.</h3>

<p>The Auditors were not to be left long in sole possession of
the military arena of the Civil Service, for Corps were being
rapidly raised in the Post Office, Inland Revenue, Customs,
Whitehall, and Admiralty.</p>

<p>An unsuccessful attempt was made to raise a Corps in the
British Museum.</p>

<p>Almost all of these Corps date their origin from the circular
issued from the Audit Office, inviting the co-operation of their
department. So rapidly were they organised, that towards the
end of December, 1859, they appear to have got into fair working
order; and in answer to an invitation from the Audit Office,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
a Provisional Council, consisting of two representatives from
each Corps, assembled for the purpose of taking the necessary
steps to amalgamate the whole into one Brigade.</p>

<h3>First Council Meeting.</h3>

<p>This first meeting of the Council was held on the 7th January,
1860. The following members were present, as the first chosen
representatives of their divisions, and to them may be justly
attributed the title of “The Fathers of the Regiment”:&mdash;</p>

<p>Containing, as this list does, the names of so many men that
have since become eminent in the Service, it affords ample
evidence that the Regiment could have suffered from no lack
of talent in the conduct of its affairs in its early days.</p>

<h3>Title of Corps.</h3>

<p>The first proceeding of the Council after electing Mr. Francis
Taylor, of the Audit Office, its secretary, was to resolve that
the amalgamated corps (now found to consist of 658 effective
and 410 honorary members, and stated to be “daily increasing”)
should be called the “Civil Service Rifle Brigade.” The
Admiralty representatives suggested the “Crown Rifle Brigade,”
but their amendment was not received with favour.</p>

<h3>Uniform.</h3>

<p>The Council next launched into the important subject of
uniform, a subject of which the details occupied their attention
at several successive meetings, and in regard to which some of
the members displayed great energy. Apparently unmindful of
the terrors of a military tailor’s bill, each attended the meeting
in the pattern of uniform that he individually recommended.
Mr. Tom Taylor was one of these energetic members, and to
him it appears that the regiment was indebted for the pattern
of most of the uniform ultimately selected; for we find that
with regard to the full dress of both privates and officers, the
decision of the Council was that “the uniform worn by Mr. Tom
Taylor be adopted.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<p>The uniform as then fixed was similar in all main points to
that so recently discarded. It was, perhaps, a little more
sombre in appearance, for the royal blue facings, silver lace,
and Prince of Wales’ feathers were added at a later date (1863).
The cost, including chako, was &pound;4 4s.</p>

<p>Affairs were not to remain for long in the semi-amalgamated
corps in a state of perfect harmony. A disagreement, amounting
to an open breach, even occurred on this early question of
uniform; for at the third meeting of the Council, held on the
31st January, a letter from the Customs Corps was read, stating
that “<i>they declined to adopt the ornaments on the belts as decided
upon by the Council, and that they would therefore have no participation
in the arrangements of the Civil Service Regiment</i>.”</p>

<h3>Customs Corps Secede.</h3>

<p>The Customs had, from the first, shown an inclination to fall
off. It appears that, being a strong corps, they considered
they were entitled to be represented on the Council by more
than two representatives.</p>

<p>With an expression of regret for their withdrawal, “more
especially on a matter so trivial,” the Council accepted the loss;
and when the authority for the amalgamation was ultimately
received from the War Office, it referred only to the 27th Middlesex
(Inland Revenue), the 31st (Whitehall), and the 34th
(Admiralty), which were to be amalgamated with the 21st
Middlesex (Audit Office and Post Office), the battalion to be
entitled “The Civil Service Corps of Rifle Volunteers,” with
an authorised maximum strength of 800.</p>

<h3>Prince of Wales.</h3>

<p>At its second meeting, the Council had decided upon the
important step of inviting the Prince of Wales to accept the
Honorary Colonelcy of the Regiment. They were induced to
take this step by the hopes held out to them through Mr. George
Alexander Hamilton, Secretary to the Treasury, to whose influence
the success of the application was mainly attributed;
for by the beginning of May an intimation was received that,
with the sanction of Her Majesty and the Prince Consort, His
Royal Highness had graciously consented to accept the post.
And from the honour thus accorded it the Regiment has never
ceased to derive the greatest benefit. To be singled out in
these early days as the Regiment through whom this mark of
Royal favour was to be shown to the Volunteer force, was a
distinction which placed it at once in the forefront of public
estimation, whilst the interest which, on many occasions, the
Prince has since exhibited in its welfare has contributed largely
to the prosperity of the corps.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

<h3>Chaplain.</h3>

<p>The first Staff appointment which the Council succeeded in
filling was that of Chaplain, offered to, and accepted by, the
Rev. Charles Kingsley, afterwards Canon Kingsley.</p>

<h3>C.O.</h3>

<p>The important post of Lieutenant-Colonel or Commanding
Officer was not so easily filled. It was offered first to Sir E.
Lugard, and afterwards to Lord West, but both were unable to
undertake the duties. At length, at a meeting held on the
15th May, on a proposition of Captain Mills, the Council decided
that Viscount Bury be invited to take the command of the
regiment. This application proved more successful, for although
Lord Bury had connected himself to a slight extent with the
“Artists’” Corps, which had just been formed, the impediment
was soon removed, and before the end of June his lordship
attended a meeting of the Council, and a few days afterwards
was gazetted Lieutenant-Colonel of the Regiment.</p>

<p>Lord Bury at this time occupied the official position of
Treasurer to the Royal Household, and, together with Lord
Ranelagh, Lord Elcho, and the Duke of Westminster, was one
of the prominent leaders of the Volunteer movement.</p>

<h3>Adjutant.</h3>

<p>The appointment of an Adjutant also caused difficulty. A
committee consisting of a few members of the Council was
elected to consider the applications for the post. The choice
of this committee fell upon Captain Ennis, who was a member
of the Corps, and Captain-Commandant of the Inland Revenue
Companies. Captain Ennis had at one time been in the
“Hussars.”</p>

<p>The War Office, however, refused to accept Captain Ennis as
Adjutant, on the ground that he was over fifty, and that his
service in the army had been in connection with the Cavalry.
The feeling in the Regiment was very strong against this decision,
and grave consequences with regard to the prosperity of the
Corps were said to be likely to ensue if the War Office refused
to appoint so popular an officer.</p>

<p>One of the first tasks which Lord Bury undertook, by desire
of the Council, was to overcome the objection raised by the
War Office. In this he was successful, and Captain Ennis was
appointed to the post, which, however, he held for two years
only, when he resigned.</p>

<h3>Surgeon.</h3>

<p>With the authority for the appointment of Captain Ennis to
the Adjutancy came also that of Dr. Spencer Smith to the post
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
of Surgeon. This gentleman resigned only a few years ago,
after a service of 24 years. In the early days his office was by
no means the apparent sinecure it has since become, for it was
the duty of the Surgeon, or the Assistant Surgeon, to attend at
the range whenever target practice was held, and for the zealous
and kind manner in which this duty was carried out, at great
sacrifice of time and convenience, the Commanding Officer, in
regimental orders, expressed the warmest thanks of the Regiment.</p>

<p>The amount of zeal with which the Surgeons entered upon
their work in those days is exemplified by the following unpleasantly
expressive item in the Regimental accounts of that
period:</p>

<table class="w100">

  <tr>
  <td style="padding-left: 4em">Range</td>
  <td class="tdr">&pound;4 4 0.”</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Major.</h3>

<p>The War Office, at that time, required that Majors of Volunteer
Corps should have served in the Army, so that it was not until
April, 1861, that the post of Major was filled by the appointment
of Major Leslie (late Captain 1st Life Guards).</p>

<p>With this exception the formation of the Regiment may
now (June, 1860) be said to have been complete. It was composed
as follows:</p>

<h3>Composition of Corps.</h3>

<p>These numbers scarcely convey a correct impression of the
hold which the corps had secured upon the Civil Service. It
must be remembered that, in addition to the effective strength
as given above, there were at least 500 honorary members
including many who occupied leading official positions. These
were individuals who were debarred by age or other reasons
from drilling, but who, nevertheless, were quite as enthusiastic
in advocating the new “movement” as their more active
comrades in the ranks.</p>

<p>Of the latter it may be said that, on the whole, they were men
of more advanced age and position than we are now accustomed
to see in the ranks. Shouldering the rifle amongst them were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
many men now of note&mdash;Lord Lingen, Sir R. G. C. Hamilton,
Lord Teynham, and others. The name of Mr. Tom Taylor the
well known dramatic author, afterwards editor of <i>Punch</i>, has
already been mentioned; whilst other literary and scientific
men the corps could then claim were Professor Huxley, Professor
Tyndall, Mr. Anthony Trollope, Mr. W. S. Gilbert, and Mr.
Edmund Yates.</p>

<p>To turn from the doings of the Council to those of the Regiment
itself, we find that the first parade of the combined corps “for
the purpose of drilling as a battalion” was held at Somerset
House on the 28th March, 1860.</p>

<h3>First Battalion Drill, &amp;c.</h3>

<p>This parade was in plain clothes and without arms, but in
the following week the regiment mustered in uniform and under
arms. Captain Ennis (afterwards Adjutant) took the command
at these drills.</p>

<p>The following week the regiment was ready for its first “march
out.” This notable event was held at Wimbledon, amidst
torrents of rain, and is commemorated by a sketch made by
Captain Angell, a photograph of which hangs in the Orderly
Room. The expense of this march was defrayed by a collection
of ten shillings per man.</p>

<p>From this time, instruction in battalion drill proceeded with
great vigour. The use of the West London Cricket Ground at
Brompton was obtained for the purpose, and the regiment
marched there weekly, whilst other battalion drills and
“skeleton drills” for officers were held almost daily at
Somerset House.</p>

<p>Matters proceeded so rapidly on the appointment of a
Lieutenant-Colonel, that Lord Bury considered that the Corps
might be safely exposed to the perils of a sham fight to be held
by the Metropolitan Volunteers at Bromley, on the 14th July.
This, however, did not appear to be the opinion of the regiment
itself when the day arrived. The muster was very small. It
was attributed afterwards by Lord Bury in Orders, to the fact
that “many members of the regiment had resolved not to come
on account of the danger to be apprehended from the inexperience
of their comrades in firing drill.”</p>

<p>The members themselves, however, seemed very anxious to
remedy this minor defect on their part, and musketry instruction
now became the rage. To carry this out successfully it was
necessary that a staff of Volunteer Instructors should be raised,
who in their turn should instruct the other members of the
Regiment.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

<h3>Musketry Instruction.</h3>

<p>The arduous duties carried out by these Volunteer Musketry
Instructors certainly entitle them to especial mention. At their
head was Captain Du Plat Taylor, assisted by Ensign Campbell
and Battalion Instructor Halliday. The first Company Instructors
in the order of merit in which they passed their examination
were:</p>

<p>Every available place in the neighbourhood of Somerset House
was occupied nightly by squads practising “position” and
“aiming” drill, and by August, Captain Du Plat Taylor was
able to take his first squad to the Wimbledon range for ball
practice. This was carried out in the strictest and most methodical
manner, for even in those days, Captain Taylor began to
earn for himself the character of the strict disciplinarian for
which he has since been so noted. The following facts are
gathered from the regulations laid down by him in Regimental
Musketry Orders:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“All Target Practice to be performed in Uniform, in Full Marching
Order.</p>

<p>“Members proceeding to Wimbledon for Firing Practice to fall
in in Military Order at the station at Putney, and march to the
range under the command of the senior present. On arrival at the
range they would be delivered over to the Senior Musketry Instructor.
The return to Putney to be conducted in the same manner. <i>Strict
silence to be maintained in the ranks throughout the whole of the
proceedings.</i></p>

<p>“With the view of avoiding the heavy expenses incurred by the
hire of Butt Markers, the duties to be undertaken by members of
the Corps; three non-commissioned officers and three privates being
previously detailed on each occasion.</p>

<p>“Should any member so detailed refuse or neglect to attend, he
would be disqualified from competing for Regimental Prizes.”</p></blockquote>

<p>However necessary these rules may have been at the time, it
need scarcely be observed that before long they were found to
be irksome. Rumour reports that on the occasion of a squad,
on its return from the ranges in the dark, being marched into
a ditch, open mutiny broke out with regard to the obnoxious
rules, and that Captain Taylor was thereupon constrained to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
relax his discipline until he could find more tractable material to
work upon than the “gentlemen of the Civil Service.”</p>

<h3>Queen’s Review.</h3>

<p>Two events of the year 1860 must not be omitted. One was
the first grand Volunteer Review before the Queen, in Hyde
Park, when the Civil Service, under Lord Bury, formed part of
a brigade under Lord Ranelagh.</p>

<p>In reference to this event Lord Bury states, “The behaviour
of all ranks on the ground was steady and soldierlike, and the
general appearance presented by the Regiment was all that
could be desired.”</p>

<p>Another was the celebration of the Prince of Wales’ birthday
by an inspection at Somerset House, followed by a Regimental
Dinner.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span></p>

<h2 id="PART_I_CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="medium">Eccentricities.</span></h2>

<p>Looking back from the sober routine of the volunteering of
to-day, to this strange period when every one was a recruit, it
is only natural that eccentricities should be apparent on all
sides. The enthusiasm that pervaded all ranks was, of course,
immense, and the amount of drilling done, especially by the
Officers and Non-Commissioned Officers was enormous. A
golden age was this for the Army Drill-Instructors. Elderly
recruits of a nervous temperament hesitated to exhibit themselves
in the ranks until they had been privately coached in the
initial mysteries of drill, in the seclusion of their own apartments.
Uniform was worn on every possible occasion, at drill or on
the range. It is said that after one occasion when Lord Bury
had appeared at the range in plain clothes, he received a
letter from an indignant private, expressing a hope that
such a slight would not again be cast upon members of the
regiment.</p>

<p>One Rule passed by the Council was that Honorary Members
should be entitled to appear on parade in uniform, with a scarlet
sash as a distinguishing ornament.</p>

<p>Another Rule strikes us as still more eccentric. Privates
<i>when off parade</i> should be allowed to wear a sword similar to
that worn by officers, but in a black leather scabbard. What
the privates were supposed to want to do with their sword
when off parade it is difficult to imagine.</p>

<p>With the close of the drill season the Regiment does not cease
to show signs of interesting activity. Whilst in winter quarters
it enlivened its repose with various festive gatherings having for
their main object the support of the regimental band, which was
in want of funds.</p>

<h3>Dramatic Performance.</h3>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting of these gatherings is an Amateur
Dramatic Performance, held at the Lyceum Theatre, wherein
the corps exhibited an array of talent, of which it might justly
feel proud. The performance was so successful that it was
repeated. The following is a copy of the programme:

<h3>Regimental Ball.</h3>

<p>A Regimental Ball was also given at Willis’s Rooms, in aid of
the same object. In the list of the Lady Patronesses are the
names of:</p>

<p class="table">
The Duchess of Manchester.<br />

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
Viscountess Palmerston.<br />
Viscountess Bury.<br />
Lady Elcho.<br />
Mrs. Gladstone.<br />
</p>

<h3>Band.</h3>

<p>The Band, on behalf of which so much energy was expended,
was composed of 25 members, the greater number of whom
were amateurs. It appears to have been in an excellent state
of efficiency, as it gained prizes at various band contests, which
it was then the fashion to hold. It was under the charge of an
energetic and capable bandmaster, Mr. J. Moirato Davis; but
very valuable assistance was rendered to its efficiency by Mr.
W. P. Jones, of the Audit Office. Its annual cost to the regiment
appears to have been about &pound;300.</p>

<h3>Subscription Fund.</h3>

<p>As there was no Government grant in those days to assist in
defraying the expenses of the corps these had to be met entirely
by voluntary contributions, and the subscriptions of members.</p>

<p>The Council issued a circular asking for assistance from the
whole of the Civil Service. Subscriptions flowed in liberally.
In the Inland Revenue and Whitehall Divisions alone the
subscriptions in the first year exceeded &pound;1,000.</p>

<h3>1861. First Easter Monday Review.</h3>

<p>The opening of the year 1861 was marked by the first Easter
Monday Review. This was held at Brighton. Some difference
of opinion was displayed by the various Volunteer Commanding
Officers as to the advisability of holding this review. Lord
Bury opposed the idea. He expressed his opinions on the point
in a Regimental Order to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I do not think the proposed expedition judicious in a political
point of view. I think it inconsistent with the purely defensive
character of the Volunteer movement to make demonstrations on
the coast.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, under these conditions the Civil Service Regiment
refrained from demonstrating; or, at all events, they joined
with a few other like-minded corps, and so effectually concealed
their demonstrations among the bushes of Wimbledon Common,
that they evidently felt satisfied that not the slightest exasperation
could have been felt on their account by the most bellicose
of Frenchmen.</p>

<h3>1862.</h3>

<p>Little else of importance occurred to mark the year 1861, so
we will pass at once to the second Easter Monday Review,
which ushered in the drill season of 1862.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

<p>By this time it would appear that Lord Bury’s views had
changed, for the regiment not only attended the Review, but
in a Regimental Order, in which he praises the steadiness of the
battalion on that occasion, Lord Bury states&mdash;“It is an honour
to have taken part in such a day.”</p>

<p>Another event of this year was a review by the Duke of
Cambridge at Wimbledon, when we are told that His Royal
Highness expressed his praise on witnessing the advance of the
battalion extended as skirmishers.</p>

<p>To show the satisfactory state of affairs at this period, I cannot
do better than again to quote from Regimental Orders as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Lieutenant-Colonel cannot but congratulate the Regiment
on the fact that at the close of their third drill season, they occupy
a most satisfactory position among the Volunteer Corps of the
country: the organisation is complete; the numbers are increasing;
the Officers have passed the ordeal of a searching examination;
the Drill is improved; the Musketry Instruction, which was from
the first the strongest point in the organisation of the Regiment,
has even improved in efficiency; and the number both of effectives
and of marksmen is fully equal, in proportion to numbers, to any
other Volunteer Corps. The Lieutenant-Colonel need not point
out how much the efficiency of a Regiment depends on its Non-commissioned
Officers. We are fortunate in having a body of
Non-commissioned Officers who thoroughly know their duty. The
Skirmishing Drill of the Regiment is better done, and much more
clearly understood than in former years. <i>In conclusion, the
Lieutenant-Colonel confidently believes that the utmost unanimity and
good feeling exists throughout the Regiment.</i>”</p></blockquote>

<p>The last statement appears, in the present day, a rather
strange and superfluous one to put into Regimental Orders; but
it is evident that its meaning was fully understood at the time.
Enthusiastic volunteer as Lord Bury was, and evidently taking
a delight in his duties as Commanding Officer, he must have
frequently felt that to rule a body of gentlemen volunteers, in
a very elementary stage of military knowledge and discipline,
was a somewhat formidable and even thankless task. Every
member of the corps&mdash;officer, non-commissioned officer, and
private&mdash;had an opinion to express on every point, and he
expressed it freely. Plenty of evidence exists of burning questions
which agitated, and sometimes even threatened the unity
of the corps; but the great tact displayed by Lord Bury, his
forbearance and kindly courtesy, which disarmed all opposition,
led the corps safely through all.</p>

<p>One incident which occurred about this period, and the
explanations with regard to which occupy the greater part of
three Regimental Orders, was, that a part of the Regiment had
expressed unwillingness to join in a march out with the “Artists’”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
Corps, owing to what Lord Bury describes as “an absurd wish
attributed to him to bring about an amalgamation between the
Civil Service Regiment and the Artists’.”</p>

<p>But it is not necessary here to go into the details of these
almost forgotten grievances, which, although interesting as
showing what may be called the <i>morale</i> of the Corps at that
period, are perhaps best buried in oblivion.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<h2 id="PART_I_CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>1863. Prince of Wales’ Challenge Cup.</h3>

<p>At the commencement of the year 1863, the Prince of Wales
showed his interest in the Corps by presenting it with a Challenge
Cup of the value of 100 guineas. The nominal right to hold this
cup for a year is still annually shot for; but it is customary
for the Commanding Officer to retain it in his own custody.</p>

<p>This was the year of the Prince of Wales’s marriage, and on
the 7th March the Regiment took part in the parade of the
Metropolitan Volunteers in Hyde Park, on the arrival of the
Princess Alexandra in London. The “Civil Service” were
granted the post of honour on the right of the line, on this
occasion.</p>

<p>The Regiment again attended the Easter Monday Review at
Brighton, and earned golden opinions for itself, receiving, we
are told, from Officers of high rank, great commendation for
their steadiness at drill.</p>

<p>In this year (three years after their formation) the Volunteers
were first thought worthy of an annual Capitation Grant by the
Government. &pound;1 was paid for every efficient member who
completed three Company and six Battalion Drills.</p>

<h3>Adjutants: Captain Adair, 1862-3.<br />
Captain Lombard, 1864-1886.</h3>

<p>It has not yet been mentioned that Captain Alexander W.
Adair was appointed to the Corps as Adjutant, in May, 1862.
Towards the close of this year (1863) he resigned, and with the
opening of 1864 we form the acquaintance of one who has left
an indelible mark on the history of the Civil Service Rifles.
On the 17th March, 1864, Captain Graves C. Swan Lombard
(late of the 16th Regiment) was appointed Acting Adjutant,
and for the long period of 22 years from this date his name
appears at the foot of Regimental Orders.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but that, from his very first appearance
in the Corps, Captain (afterwards Major) Lombard ingratiated
himself into the goodwill of all its members; and it is little to
say, that all who had the pleasure of serving with him will ever
have pleasing recollections of his kindly manner, his admirable
tact, his quiet but firm discipline. These, with many other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
excellent qualities, combined to make him, in the opinion of all
the true model of a Volunteer Adjutant.</p>

<p>One of the first Orders signed by Major Lombard was, however,
somewhat unfortunate, containing as it did the following
paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Post Office Companies will proceed to Harrow on
Saturday, 24th inst., to join in a Field Day with the Harrow
School and other Corps. Each member to provide himself with
twenty rounds of ball cartridge.”</p>

<p>It is never too late to acknowledge a mistake, so on the 26th
inst. (only <i>two</i> days after the Review was held) the correction
comes:</p>

<p>“In the Order of the 17th inst., the words ‘<span class="smcap">BALL</span> cartridge’
should have been ‘<span class="smcap">BLANK</span> cartridge.’”</p>

<p>Let us hope the Harrow boys suffered no inconvenience from
the error.</p>

<h3>1864.</h3>

<p>The year 1864 is noted for two events of importance. The
first was a Review in Hyde Park, when the “Civil Service”
formed part of a brigade under the command of the Prince of
Wales. The second was an Inspection of the Regiment by the
Prince on the 15th June, at Somerset House. A letter from
the Prince to Lord Bury was afterwards published in Orders,
in which His Royal Highness stated that both he and the
Princess, who accompanied him, were much gratified by the
Inspection.</p>

<p>The events of one year are now found to be so much like
those of another that it is unnecessary to follow each year in
detail. We will, therefore, only refer to the prominent features
which mark from this time the history of the Corps.</p>

<h3>Shooting of Period.</h3>

<p>A few words about the shooting of the period. “H” Company
appears to have been the best shooting Company at this time,
whilst “C” Company stood by far the lowest in the list of
marksmen. Private E. Plasket was evidently the “crack”
shot of the Regiment. Lord Bury’s name also figures well in
Regimental Competitions. In 1865 he headed the 3rd class
scores with 72 out of a possible 80&mdash;a score which even in these
days of Martinis would be treated with great respect.</p>

<h3>Majors.</h3>

<p>In 1865, Members of the Regiment for the first time filled the
post of Major, the two senior Captains, Hawker and Du Plat
Taylor, being promoted.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

<h3>1866&mdash;Bank of England Company.</h3>

<p>An important event in the history of the Corps occurred in
1866, in the formation of a new Company, composed of members
of the Clerical Establishment of the Bank of England. The
Bank had as yet taken no active part in the Volunteer movement;
but the Directors, following the traditions of their
predecessors of the last century, were very favourably inclined
towards it. It was with little difficulty, therefore, that Mr.
Kingsmill, to whose energy the formation of the Company was
principally due, succeeded in recruiting a sufficiently large
contingent to make them an acceptable acquisition to any
leading Metropolitan Corps.</p>

<p>An attempt was made to draw them into the ranks of the
London Rifle Brigade. Although not servants of the Crown,
however, it was felt that there were bonds of affinity which
drew them closer to the Civil Service than to any other Corps.
Lord Bury’s sanction was readily obtained, and in July, 1866,
they joined, 140 strong, under the command of one of the
Directors of the Bank&mdash;Captain J. P. Currie.</p>

<p>To make room for the new Company, the 1st Whitehall, or
F Company, which was then in a weak state, was amalgamated
with the 2nd Whitehall, or G Company, and the Bank took
rank after the Admiralty as the K Company.</p>

<h3>Camp at Wimbledon.</h3>

<p>In the Orders of 1866 we find the first notice of a Regimental
Camp, to be held at the Wimbledon Meeting. These were the
days when Wimbledon was the <i>only</i> camp&mdash;a huge Volunteer
“picnic,” suggestive of camp bonfires and unlimited festivity.
It was certainly the first experience which the Regiment appears
to have had in camp life. In the Order giving details, one of the
most prominent paragraphs recommends members to bring
<i>sheets</i> and a <i>corkscrew</i>!</p>

<h3>Major Du Plat Taylor.</h3>

<p>In April, 1868, Major Du Plat Taylor resigned. Major Du Plat
Taylor had from the first been one of the most prominent and
energetic officers of the Corps. He had a strong desire, which
he expressed in a circular issued in 1864, to raise a third Company
in the Post Office, and then to form a separate battalion under
his own command. Although not successful in this very questionable
scheme, he now resigned in order to take command of
a new corps (the 49th, now the 24th Middlesex), raised from the
Sorters and Letter Carriers of the Post Office. His success
at the head of this regiment is well known.</p>

<p>The vacancy caused by this promotion was filled by the promotion
of Captain Currie, of the Bank of England, to be Major.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<h3>1871.</h3>

<p>The next events of importance occur in the year 1871. This
was a period of some military excitement, caused by the Franco-German
War. The old Enfield rifle was called in, and the Snider
breechloader issued to Volunteers.</p>

<h3>School of Instruction.</h3>

<p>Schools of Instruction for Volunteer Officers were instituted
by the Army authorities. These supplied a want that had
been much felt, as much by the “Civil Service” as by other
Corps; for although the more energetic Officers occasionally
obtained permission to be attached to a Regiment of Regulars
for a short period, the instruction thus obtained does not appear
to have been very thorough.</p>

<p>Indeed, the blunders of Commanding Officers, eccentric words
of command, and suchlike, form the staple commodity of the
“Volunteer” humour of the period. It is related that on one
occasion, when the “Civil Service” were marching down Fleet
Street, a Field Officer, rushing to the front, delivered himself of
the following: “Battalion&mdash;<span class="smcap">FOURS RIGHT</span>. No, I mean <span class="smcap">FOURS
LEFT</span>. No&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;. D&mdash;&mdash;n it. <i>Turn up Fetter Lane.</i>”</p>

<p>Lord Bury was the first Officer of the Corps to take advantage
of the new institution, and in 1871 he attended the School at
Chelsea Barracks, and obtained the “pass” certificate. Since
that time it has been the rule for all Officers to pass the School
as soon as possible after receiving a commission.</p>

<h3>Major Hawker.</h3>

<p>In this year (1871) Major Hawker resigned. On his resignation
he was entertained by the Regiment at a dinner given in his
honour at St. James’s Hall; and, in a special Regimental Order
issued for the occasion, he was thanked by Lord Bury for the
services which he had rendered the Corps. His vacancy was
filled by the promotion of Captain Mills.</p>

<p>We now approach a period when a greater variety was displayed
in the annual military programme of the Corps. Camps
of Instruction were instituted&mdash;the first in 1873. Detachments
from the Corps attended the Autumn Manœuvres of the Army
and the Aldershot Summer Drills; but to these matters we will
refer more fully in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<h3>50th Middlesex Formed.</h3>

<p>In 1875 a new Corps (one of the last formed in Middlesex)
was raised from the porters and subordinate establishment of
the Bank of England. After the disbandment of the Bank
Volunteers in 1814, the Directors still considered it advisable
to train a certain number of their <i>employ&eacute;s</i> to the use of arms,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
to be employed, if necessary, for the defence of the Bank. Their
porters and messengers were specially selected with a view to
this purpose, and arms and uniform were provided by the Bank.
The year 1875 found them a rather antiquated body of men,
armed with the Brown Bess musket, with which weapon they
made an annual excursion to the butts, and underwent their
sole military exercise, at great peril to themselves and to the
surrounding neighbourhood.</p>

<p>At this period, efforts were made to bring them within the
scope of the Volunteer Regulations. The only difficulty in the
way was the requirement of the Directors to employ them solely
for the defence of the Bank property. After some demur,
however, the Government consented to admit them, and they
were enrolled as the 50th Middlesex&mdash;afterwards changed to
the 25th.</p>

<p>The Corps consisted of one Company only, about 100 strong,
under the command of Captain Gray, Chief Accountant of the
Bank. They chose for their uniform the dark-green and busby
of the Rifle Brigade, and were attached for drill purposes to the
“Civil Service” Corps.</p>

<h3>Dramatic Society.</h3>

<p>In 1876 a Regimental Dramatic Society was inaugurated with
great <i>&eacute;clat</i>. Although the Corps was unable to boast of such
noted names as were seen on the programme of its performance
of 1861, yet there was found to be an abundance of dramatic
talent in its ranks. Moreover, some of the celebrities referred
to gladly gave their services to their old Corps. Mr. W. S.
Gilbert personally superintended the rehearsals for the production
of one of his own plays, “On Guard,” which was selected
for the opening performance; and the veteran Mr. Tom Taylor
contributed a Prologue for the occasion.</p>

<p>For several years the Club continued to give excellent performances
in St. George’s Hall, and with the funds thus obtained
gratuitous entertainments were provided at the various Camps.</p>

<p>Aldershot, Wimbledon, and the Camps of Instruction owe
many a jovial evening to the efforts of the Dramatic Club.
There came a time, however, when the support given by the
general body of the Corps began to fall off, and it was necessary
to discontinue the performances. Let us hope that it will not
be long before the dramatic spirit again revives in the ranks.</p>

<h3>Major Currie.</h3>

<p>In 1879 Major Currie resigned. The Regiment had benefited
much by Major Currie’s services. Lord Bury having suffered
from bad health about this period, Major Currie for some time
carried out the duties of Commanding Officer, and earned for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
himself much popularity in the Corps. His post was filled by
the promotion of a brother Director of the Bank, Captain A. G.
Sandeman, of K Company.</p>

<h3>Lord Bury.</h3>

<p>Mention should not be omitted of the fact that at this period
(1878-80) the Corps had the gratification of seeing its Commanding
Officer (Lord Bury) occupying the post of Under Secretary
of State for War. In this capacity he presided over a Committee
appointed by Government to investigate and report on the
requirements of the Volunteer Force. There is no doubt that
the more generous treatment which the Force has received from
Government of late years is owing in a great degree to the
Report of this Committee.</p>

<h3>Title Altered.</h3>

<p>In 1880 a scheme for re-numbering the Middlesex Corps was
adopted by the War Office. Many of the Corps formed in 1860
had become defunct or had been amalgamated with others. The
“Civil Service,” from the 21st, thus became the 12th Middlesex.
A few years later, when the territorial system was arranged, they
were classified as the 5th Volunteer Battalion of the King’s Royal
Rifle Corps, but this title has not yet been adopted.</p>

<h3>21st Year.</h3>

<p>In 1881 the Volunteer Force celebrated its coming of age, and
Her Majesty marked the event by reviewing her “citizen
soldiers.” The English Volunteers mustered in Windsor Great
Park, on the 9th July, 1881, and marched past their Sovereign.
A few weeks later the Queen proceeded to Scotland, and reviewed
the Scottish Corps at Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The “Civil Service” decided to celebrate their arrival at
maturity by a grand dinner of past and present members. The
Prince of Wales graciously consented to preside on the occasion,
and this necessitated delaying the festival until the following
year. The dinner was ultimately held at Willis’s Rooms, on
the 1st March, 1882. The demands for admission were many
times in excess of the space available, and the process of balloting
for tickets was resorted to in the case of past members.</p>

<p>A distinguished company of guests were invited to meet the
Prince, who, as Chairman, made several speeches, in the course
of which he warmly complimented the regiment, and expressed
his wish to meet it at the Portsmouth Review the following
Easter. This wish was carried out. The Prince was present
at Portsmouth for some days, and appeared in public on each
occasion in his uniform as Colonel of the Civil Service Corps.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
At the march past, on the day of the Review, he took command
of the battalion, and marched past at its head.</p>

<p>Her Majesty further complimented the Volunteer Force in
this year, by appointing, for the first time, certain of its commanding
officers Aides-de-Camp to the Queen. Lord Bury was one of
the six selected for this honour.</p>

<p>In 1884 Major Sandeman resigned, and the Honourable Arnold
Keppel, the eldest son of Lord Bury, formerly of the Scots
Guards, was appointed junior Major.</p>

<h3>Change of Rifle.</h3>

<p>In 1885 the Snider Rifles were called in and Martinis issued to
Volunteer Corps. For a few years before this, a limited number
of Martinis had been lent to each corps for the use of men who
shot for the Queen’s Prize at Wimbledon. (The rifles of the
“Civil Service” were again changed in 1890 for Martinis of a
later pattern, with which the sword-bayonet was issued in lieu
of the bayonet of the old type.)</p>

<h3>Adjutants.</h3>

<p>In 1886 Major Lombard retired from the post of Adjutant,
having served to the full limit of age allowed by the War Office
Regulations in force on his appointment. The Corps now came
under the operation of the rule at present in force, by which
an officer on the Active List of the Army is appointed for five
years only, when he returns to his regiment. Under this rule
Captain A. G. S. Beadnell, of the King’s Own Scottish Borderers,
was appointed, <i>vice</i> Major Lombard.</p>

<h3>Jubilee Year.</h3>

<p>The Volunteer “events” which marked the Jubilee Year of
1887 will ever make it memorable to those who took part in
them. The Civil Service Corps were fully represented at each
of these&mdash;The Royal Procession to the Abbey; the March Past
the Queen at Buckingham Palace, when the Corps had the
honour of being led by H.R.H. the Prince of Wales; and last,
but not least, the gigantic Military Review at Aldershot. On
the last-mentioned occasion, in order to parade at the early
hour of four in the morning, the detachment was billeted for the
previous night at Somerset House.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

<h2 id="PART_I_CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>Wimbledon Ranges.</h3>

<p>No history of the Corps could be accepted as complete which
omitted an account of the Wimbledon Ranges; for it is around
them that, with many of us, the pleasantest memories of volunteering
life will cling&mdash;some of its sweetest triumphs, and also,
perhaps, some of its keenest disappointments. <i>Here</i> we have
endeavoured to learn, with more or less success, how to bear the
pride of victory, as well as the sting of defeat, with that impassive
demeanour which is held to become the well-bred Briton.</p>

<p>Then, too, are they not the more interesting because they are,
in themselves, <i>glorious</i> ranges? Not, perhaps, with regard to
their adaptability to good shooting. They have a fish-tail
wind that is trying, and a semaphore that is&mdash;worse. But the
grand view! Across the wide common, with its gorse, heather,
and fern, its quiet dells, its shady copses, and its broad, open,
wind-swept plateaux, to the beautiful glades of Richmond Park,
and far, far away to the distant Surrey Hills. Then, the pure,
bracing breeze, coming as it does just over the top of Leith Hill,
straight from the sea, giving more health and vigour in one short
afternoon than any doctor’s tonic taken for a month.</p>

<p>Every landmark around has been familiar to us for years,
and most are associated with some incident which renders them
attractive. Here, for instance, is the spot where we fired our
first shot as a recruit. (We have never fired at that ridiculous
distance since.) How well do we remember that awful event!
How we screwed up our courage to the sticking-point, firmly
resolved to “let off” that dread weapon; but in our own mind
the immediate future was full of vague uncertainty. With
what feelings of utter indifference we received the sergeant’s
congratulations that we had hit the target. It had gone off!
We were alive and well, and the world moved on as before!
There was no room in our mind for anything else.</p>

<p>Well, well! That intense feeling of respect for a loaded rifle
very soon wore off. Let us return to the sober facts of history.</p>

<p>The Wimbledon Ranges have been used by the “Civil Service”
from the very commencement of the Corps. The Sub-Committee
appointed by the Council in 1860 to seek for a Range were not
long in discovering Wimbledon. The Ranges were then in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
possession of the 11th Surrey Volunteers, who rented them from
the Lord of the Manor, Earl Spencer, for the sum of one shilling
yearly. They agreed to allow the “Civil Service” to share the
shooting accommodation, on the understanding that the latter
paid three-fourths of the cost of the erection of the Butts.</p>

<p>One feels compelled to remark that the Regimental authorities
have never been very happy in their management of matters
connected with these ranges. Affairs were commenced with a
lawsuit, brought by the contractor who erected the Butts, and
the Corps lost the day.</p>

<p>In 1861 the London Scottish, who had opened adjoining
ranges, proposed to build a Shooting House. They invited the
“Civil Service” to join them in the undertaking, and to become
joint owners. The Council, however, did not consider it advisable
to do so, but preferred to pay a yearly rent for a share in the
tenancy. In 1864 the Council again refused an offer to become
joint owners, and the result has been that the Corps has paid
in annual rent considerably more than would have sufficed to
build the house, enjoying meanwhile comparatively poor
accommodation, and having no voice in its management.</p>

<p>Matters were considerably disturbed in 1871 by the passing
of the Wimbledon Commons Act, and by the appointment of
Conservators to protect the interests of the Common-holders.
The Act went so far as to recognise the established privileges of
the Volunteers in using the Ranges, although shooting was
henceforth restricted to certain days of the week, and to certain
hours of the day. But ever since then the Conservators of the
Common, with their restrictions, protests, and objections, have
been a thorn in the side of the Regimental Range Committee.</p>

<p>In 1880 a lawsuit was commenced by the tenant of the land
bordering the Common near the Range, on the ground that
injury was caused by bullets falling on his land. The action
was brought against the “Civil Service” only, but had for its
object the closing of the whole of the Ranges in this corner of
the Common. After being protracted over a period of several
years, the action resulted in the closing of the 1st class targets,
and the substitution of wooden or canvas targets, instead of
iron, at the 2nd class range.</p>

<p>With this concession the Corps may be said to have established
its title to the use of the Ranges. The War Office have lately
instituted more than one careful inspection, and have decided
that they are “safe,” so that it may be hoped that the Corps will
continue to enjoy possession for many years to come.</p>

<h3>The Flagstaff.</h3>

<p>A noteworthy object on the Wimbledon Range is the flagstaff.
This is 153 feet high, and has the reputation of being the tallest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
flagstaff in England of one piece only. It is known as the
“Douglas Pine,” and is the product of Vancouver’s Island.
It was presented to the London Scottish in 1872 by an old
member of the Corps, who had settled on that island and felled
it on his own land. The recruit is usually informed that it
took two ships to bring it over; the explanation that one ship
brought it to Liverpool and the other to London being reserved.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the little stick in question is protected
by a somewhat formidable lightning-conductor, its predecessor
having been destroyed by lightning one afternoon whilst shooting
was going on at the Range.</p>

<p>We must not quit Wimbledon without a passing comment on
the Wimbledon Camp.</p>

<h3>Wimbledon Camp.</h3>

<p>The “Civil Service” was among the earliest of the Metropolitan
Corps which formed its own private camp at the great
rifle meeting, and from 1864 to 1885 the dark blue flag with its
Prince of Wales’s Feathers was always to be seen flying in its
own peculiar corner of the enclosure. This unbroken record
of nearly a quarter of a century was not obtained, however,
without some trouble. In the early days, when camping out
was a novelty, and Wimbledon afforded the only means of
enjoying that novelty, there was little difficulty in ensuring a
good attendance; but, with the rise of Camps of Instruction
and the Aldershot Camps, applications for the Wimbledon
tents, with their somewhat heavy fees, began to fall off. For
many years it was kept up merely by the efforts of a small band
of enthusiasts, to whom the Wimbledon “picnic,” with its
jovial round of holiday mirth, had a peculiar charm. The
support of the general body of the Corps fell off to such a marked
extent that in 1886, four years before the National Rifle Association
removed to Bisley, the Camp was discontinued.</p>

<h3>Shooting.</h3>

<p>To pass from Wimbledon and to remark briefly on the shooting
records of the Regiment is an easy digression.</p>

<p>The “Civil Service” has never yet had the good luck to
provide the winner of the Queen’s Prize, and this fact is sometimes
thrust forward by the thoughtless to detract from its
merits as a “good shooting Corps.” A simple computation will
show that, with 200,000 Volunteers to shoot for it, a Corps of
600 strong will have done its duty if it wins the prize once in
333 years! But members of the Corps have on more than one
occasion run the winner very hard. Lord Bury himself was
second for the prize in 1861.</p>

<p>Others who have been within measurable distance are: Private

W. A. Impey (Audit Office) in 1869, Lieutenant J. Mitford (Post
Office) in 1875, and Sergeant W. W. Akhurst (Post Office) in 1885.</p>

<p>Wimbledon honours have also been earned for the Corps by
Sergeant J. P. Wright (Bank of England), winner of the Grand
Aggregate in 1874; Captain H. W. E. Jeston (National Debt
Office), winner of the N.R.A. Challenge Cup in 1869; and
teams who have on various occasions won the Mappin Challenge
Cup for running and shooting.</p>

<p>Nor can we in the present year (1891) admit that the shooting
of the Corps shows any sign of declining. In the War Office
Returns for the last two years it stood first of the Metropolitan
Corps, and second in the Home District. The Regimental Team
rejoice in an almost unbroken series of victories in the numerous
matches it has shot in the same period; whilst Private Rothon,
Corporal Matthews, and Corporal Clunan well maintained the
credit of the Corps at the first meeting of the National Rifle
Association on Bisley Common. In addition to this, in Private
Rothon the Corps has the winner of the Champion Badge of
Middlesex for 1890, and, having been chosen to shoot in the
English “twenty,” he made the highest score in the International
Match of 1891.</p>

<p>A few words about Aldershot.</p>

<h3>The Aldershot Drills.</h3>

<p>The Aldershot Summer Drills appear to have been instituted
when the Autumn Manœuvres, held in 1872-3, were discontinued.
The “Civil Service” first sent a detachment to Aldershot
in 1875, and from that date, with but few exceptions, they
have annually sent a Company. This Company has been almost
always attached to the Provisional Battalion commanded by
Colonel Du Plat Taylor, of the Post Office Volunteers. Of all
the efforts taken to instil a military training into the Volunteer
none perhaps have had so great an effect as the “Aldershot
Week.” The complete change of life experienced by thus
suddenly adopting the soldier’s daily routine and hard fare, the
living with and fraternising with soldiers, the feeling that you
are for the time being actually paid as a soldier, that you are
watched by military police lest you should desert, that the
Mutiny Act has been read over you, which says that if you
disobey your officer you shall be shot&mdash;all this is calculated to
make the most light-hearted Volunteer feel that he is in earnest
at last. He enters into the spirit of the work, enjoys the novelty
of the situation&mdash;knowing that it won’t last long&mdash;and generally
comes home, grimy, sunburnt, and, in his own eyes at least, a
soldier to the backbone. The stamp it puts on a man is never
effaced. To say “he is an Aldershot-man” means that he is
entitled to considerable respect as a good Volunteer.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

<h3>Camps of Instruction.</h3>

<p>Aldershot may have been instrumental in giving us a leaven
of good soldiers, but nothing has had so great an effect in changing
the conditions of our Volunteer life as the Camps of Instruction.
As the greater part of Battalion drills are now done in
Camp, it is hardly possible for a member, as was the case in old
days, to make himself efficient by toddling round the quadrangle
at Somerset House; and this change has almost banished from
the ranks the individual generally described as the “old-fashioned
Volunteer.”</p>

<p>The first Regimental Camp of Instruction was pitched on
Wimbledon Common on the 12th May, 1873. It lasted three
days only, a longer time being forbidden by the provisions of
the Wimbledon Commons Act. The weather was very cold,
with occasional snow. The nightly attendance averaged about
100.</p>

<p>In the following year, 1874, Major Currie lent a field at Esher
for the purpose. This Camp lasted six days, and was memorable
for being the scene of one of those foolish escapades&mdash;a night
attack, delivered with great spirit by a local corps, and repulsed
with equal ardour by the “Civil Service.” In the present day,
with increased knowledge of military tactics, Volunteer officers
recognise the absurdity of such attacks.</p>

<p>In 1875, the Camp was pitched in a portion of Wimbledon
Park known as the Leg of Mutton Field, Southfields. Here
also it was located in 1876 and 1877. In the following
year, 1878, a very enjoyable Camp was held in Sandown Park,
Esher.</p>

<p>1879 will be for ever memorable, to those who took part
in it, as the year of the <i>mud</i> Camp, held in a small field, or
rather swamp, attached to an empty house near Putney
Heath.</p>

<p>Finally, in 1880, was discovered that very acme of positions&mdash;a
spot suited above all others for an encampment of Metropolitan
Volunteers&mdash;the Old Deer Park at Richmond.</p>

<h3>The Old Deer Park.</h3>

<p>Here the Corps has encamped every year since,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> and, indeed, it
would be difficult to find a more advantageous camping-ground.
Interesting in its associations as one of the oldest Royal Parks
in England, originally attached to Richmond Palace, it gives
for drill purposes an extensive area of slightly undulating parkland,
ornamented with picturesque groups of trees, among
which are some patriarchs so venerable as to make one imagine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
that they might have looked down upon the grand tournaments
held on that spot by the Tudor Kings.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">3</a>
Up till 1898, but not since.</p></div>

<p>Long may it be before any over-zealous War Office official
shall reform the Richmond Camp of Instruction out of existence.
Let us hope that for many a future generation the Civil Service
Recruit may do his lonely midnight sentry-go, in the quiet
seclusion of the Old Deer Park, with no greater peril to encounter
than the ghost of a Maid of Honour!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<h2 id="PART_I_CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p>About the year 1888 a considerable decline in the recruiting power
of the Regiment became apparent, owing chiefly to the reduction
of the establishments of many Government Offices in consequence
of the lengthening of the official day to seven hours. There were
no new entrants into the Service, and consequently no material
for recruiting.</p>

<p>By many, however, the cause was ascribed to the unattractive
uniform. This idea gained ground, and Lord Bury allowed the
opinion of the whole Regiment to be taken on the matter.</p>

<p>This was not the first time that the members of the Regiment
had been canvassed with regard to a change of uniform. In
1862 a proposal was raised in favour of <i>scarlet</i>; and again, in
1881, when Lord Bury wished his Corps to take the lead in
adopting a recommendation of the War Office Committee, of
which he was Chairman, and change to a uniform similar to
“regulars”; but on both of these occasions a large majority
of the members were found to be thoroughly conservative. The
helmet had been adopted in lieu of the Shako in 1881, but, with
this exception, the uniform remained as it had been fixed in 1863.</p>

<h3>Change of Uniform.</h3>

<p>Other views now prevailed, and out of 300 who answered the
circular addressed to them, and who expressed any opinion at
all in the matter, 220 were in favour of a change. After a
considerable time had been taken in arriving at a decision, it
was resolved to discard the dark grey for a very light grey,
retaining the Royal blue facings and the black belts of the old
uniform.</p>

<p>The sanction of the Honorary Colonel and of the War Office
having been obtained, the change was carried out at the commencement
of 1890. Taking advantage of a grant from the
Volunteer Equipment Fund raised by the Lord Mayor (Sir James
Whitehead), the Corps at the same time furnished itself with
greatcoats and the full equipment considered necessary by the
War Office; so that at the Inspection of this year the Regiment
paraded in its new uniform, and, for the first time, fully equipped.</p>

<p>The Inspection of 1890 was also remarkable for another event
of importance. For some time past Lord Bury had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
announcing his intention of shortly resigning the command of
the Corps, which he had now held for thirty years.</p>

<p>A few months before, the officers of the Corps, foreseeing the
coming resignation, had presented Lady Bury with an oil painting
of his Lordship, in the uniform of the C.S.R.V. The portrait,
by a rising young artist of the day, had been exhibited at the
Grosvenor Gallery, and had been very favourably noticed.</p>

<h3>Resignation of Lord Bury.</h3>

<p>At the close of the Inspection referred to (held in the Camp
in the Old Deer Park, Richmond) Lord Bury, in a few earnest
words, regretfully bade farewell to the Regiment in which he
had spent so large a period of his life, and with which he expressed
a hope that his family would henceforward be always connected.
He then formally handed over the command to his successor,
Major and Honorary Lieutenant-Colonel Mills; and, with an
outburst of hearty cheering in his honour, the Civil Service
Corps took leave of its first Commanding Officer.</p>

<h3>Staff Promotions.</h3>

<p>On the resignation of Lord Bury, and the appointment of
Lieutenant-Colonel Mills to the command of the Regiment,
Captain and Honorary Major J. J. Cardin, of the Post Office, was
promoted to the post of Major; and it is doubtful if in the whole
history of the Corps can be recorded any more popular promotions
than these two.</p>

<h3>Building of Head Quarters.</h3>

<p>There remains now but one more event to chronicle in order
to bring this brief category to a close, viz., the building of a
Regimental Headquarters. Ever since its formation the only
apology for a Headquarters which the Corps possessed consisted
of a single room, kindly lent by the authorities of the Exchequer
and Audit Department, in which the business of the Regimental
Staff was conducted. It had been felt for some time that the
satisfactory condition of the Corps justified an effort being made
to provide its members with similar accommodation to that
possessed by most of the London Corps. The chief difficulty
was that of obtaining a favourable site at an outlay within
reasonable limits. This difficulty was at length overcome
mainly by the exertions of Colonel Mills, through whose agency
the Government were induced to lend, under very favourable
conditions, a piece of ground between the two west wings of
Somerset House, approached from the Embankment by what
was originally the West Watergate.</p>

<p>It was estimated that a building suitable for the purpose
could be erected on this site for about &pound;3,000. At a meeting of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
officers, at which Lord Bury presided, held at the Audit Office
on 19th February, 1890, it was decided to attempt to raise this
sum by an appeal for subscriptions addressed principally to the
upper ranks of the Civil Service. H.R.H. the Prince of Wales
was graciously pleased to head the list with a donation of one
hundred guineas. The Governor and Directors of the Bank of
England subscribed a like sum, and within a few months Colonel
Mills had personally collected &pound;1,300 from the ministerial and
permanent heads of Departments and others of high rank in the
Government Offices.</p>

<h3>1892.</h3>

<p>In 1892 the Headquarters Building was formally opened. The
Prince of Wales, as Honorary Colonel, had announced his intention
of performing the ceremony, but was prevented by the
lamentable death of the Duke of Clarence which occurred in
January, and the duty was carried out by H.R.H. the Duke of
Connaught. The event was followed by a succession of “At
Homes,” dances, and other festivities to give the Regiment
a house warming in its new home.</p>

<p>The home itself was much appreciated, and at once began
to have a marked effect on the popularity and, consequently,
upon the strength and efficiency of the corps. It had, moreover,
the great merit of having been provided free of all future
debt; for it had been the firm principle of Colonel Mills, to
whose efforts the building was due, that not a brick should be
laid until the whole of the money required for building and
furnishing had been deposited in his hands.</p>

<p>Many London Regiments had built themselves fine Headquarters
about this time, but in doing so had left themselves
with the burden of a debt which sadly crippled them for many
years. It was not indeed until the buildings were handed
over to the War Office on the formation of the Territorial Force
that many Commanding Officers were relieved of heavy financial
embarrassments on this account.</p>

<p>Colonel Mills having successfully carried out the final task
he had set himself, now retired after thirty-three years of arduous
service. He was then the only member left in the corps who
had served in it from its commencement. In the following
year he became Comptroller and Auditor-General, and received
the honour of knighthood.</p>

<p>Major Viscount Bury<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> succeeded to the Command, and the
vacant post of Field Officer was filled by the promotion of
Major H. B. H. Tytheridge.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">4</a>
In 1891 the 6th Earl of Albemarle died. He was a Waterloo veteran.
By his death the first Commanding Officer succeeded to the earldom, and
gave his name to the Hon. Arnold Keppel.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

<h3>1893.</h3>

<p>The Regiment now entered upon an era of rising strength
and vigorous efficiency. Officers keen to learn found in Captain
Barton an Adjutant who was as keen to teach. Parties on
outpost work, road sketching, military topography, etc., were
soon to be found ranging the outskirts of London and of any
other place where the Civil Service were encamped, and the
result was seen in after years, when the Army List recorded a
far higher list of qualifications in “extra subjects” to the
officers of the Corps than to any other in the country.</p>

<p>Recruiting flourished, until in 1896 the Corps attained its
full strength of 800, and returns were only kept within authorised
limits by ruthlessly striking off would-be non-efficients.</p>

<h3>1894.</h3>

<p>In 1894 the Earl of Albemarle, the Regiment’s first Commanding
Officer, died, and Colonel Viscount Bury succeeded to the
title.</p>

<p>The Corps attended the Easter manœuvres at Windsor in
this year, when its Commanding Officer secured for it the much
appreciated privilege of being quartered at Eton College.</p>

<p>In July, 1894, Lieutenant-Colonel Cardin (Senior Major)
resigned after a period of thirty-four years’ service in the Corps.
The vacant post was filled by the promotion of Captain and
Honorary Major J. Mitford.</p>

<h3>1895.</h3>

<p>On the 25th May, 1895, the Prince of Wales held an inspection
of the Regiment at Chelsea Barracks. The parade strength
was 719 Civil Service, and 93 Bank of England (25th Middlesex).
The Prince, who wore the new light grey uniform of the Corps,
presented the first issue of the Long Service Medal to 40 officers
and men. The Officers’ Volunteer Decoration had been bestowed
in 1892 on 17 officers (retired and serving) of the Corps,
with the Prince’s own name heading the list.</p>

<p>The shooting of the Regiment was much restricted this year
by the closing of all but the short (300 yards) range at Wimbledon,
owing to the efforts of the Conservators of the Common, who
alleged danger to the public.</p>

<p>It was not until 1898, that by the opening of the ranges at
Runemede, the Regiment was again able to fire the full musketry
course, and the Wimbledon ranges were finally abandoned.</p>

<h3>1896.</h3>

<p>In 1896 Captain G. Lamb, Leinster Regiment, was appointed
Adjutant in the place of Captain Barton, whose time having
expired, returned to his regiment. It was with great regret
that the Civil Service parted with this officer.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

<h3>1897.</h3>

<p>1897 was the year of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria.
Unlike the Jubilee of 1887, when the Metropolitan Volunteers
turned out in their full strength to line the route, battalions
were now restricted to two companies of 25 file each. The
Civil Service Companies were commanded by the two senior
captains, Major Miall and Captain Merrick.</p>

<p>At the great Royal Naval Review at Spithead, the “H”
(Admiralty) Company under Captain Danter had the unique
experience of providing a Guard of Honour in the battleship
<i>Empress of India</i>; perhaps the only occasion on which the
Volunteer Force was represented in a Naval Review.</p>

<p>In this year the Regimental Signalling Party, who for some
time had never failed to secure a high place in the list of those
presenting themselves for official examination, now passed
first in the Kingdom.</p>

<h3>1898. “Prince of Wales’ Own.”</h3>

<p>In February, 1898, the Prince of Wales honoured the officers
by attending a Mess Dinner held at the Whitehall Rooms.
Responding to the toast of his health, the Prince complimented
Lord Albemarle on the efficiency of the Regiment, and spoke
warmly of the pleasure it gave him to remember how long he
had been its Honorary Colonel&mdash;the oldest Colonel, he thought,
in the Volunteer Force. It was announced shortly afterwards
that the Regiment was to be called “The Prince of Wales’s Own.”</p>

<h3>1899.</h3>

<p>Facilities were now being given for Volunteers to do as much
training as possible with regular troops, and the Civil Service
took advantage of this during the Easter period. In 1898 a
strong detachment were quartered at the Albuhera Barracks,
Aldershot, and in 1899 the whole Battalion were accommodated
at the Inkerman Barracks, Woking, with the 2nd East Surrey
Regiment. In reporting on outpost operations carried out
on the latter occasion, the Brigadier said: “The outpost work
was good. The placing of picquets, groups and supports left
nothing to be desired and reflects great credit on the Company
officers.”</p>

<p>An admirable test of the state of efficiency at which the
Volunteer Force had now arrived was afforded this year by the
Royal Review of Metropolitan Volunteers on the Horse Guards
Parade, held to commemorate the fortieth year of the Force.
Before midday hardly a uniform was to be seen in the streets;
but by four in the afternoon 30,000 Volunteers had mustered at
their Headquarters, marched to St. James’ Park, and formed up
in Brigades. From thence in rapid succession, after a complicated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
and trying movement, owing to the awkwardly confined
space, they marched past in column of double Companies,
debouching from the Park by the gate allotted to them to their
respective Headquarters, and by 8.0 p.m. this little army had
vanished back to civilian life. The steadiness and precision of
movement, the quiet, orderly behaviour, the neat and soldierly
appearance of the men made, without doubt, a great impression
on authorities and public alike.</p>

<p>It was well that this was so, for before the year had closed
the first demand of the country for real service was to be made
on the Force. The South African war was straining the powers
of our small regular army to its utmost limit, and in December
there was a sudden call upon the Volunteers for detachments
for voluntary service in South Africa. This call would have
been responded to much more readily if the military authorities
had not hampered it with many apparently needless restrictions.
The City Imperial Volunteers raised by the Lord Mayor was
the only body allowed to retain its identity as a Volunteer unit.
It was to this force, therefore, that London volunteers pressed
forward, and for the small quota which the Civil Service
were asked to supply, three or four times the number at once
presented themselves for medical inspection.</p>

<p>The Regiment had the pleasure of seeing its Commanding
Officer, the Earl of Albemarle, chosen for the command of the
infantry battalion; but although several other officers volunteered
their services these posts were almost entirely reserved
for members of the City Corps.</p>

<p>The history of the City Imperial Volunteers has been recounted
at length elsewhere. Suffice it to say that the Regiment embarked
on the 20th January, 1900, and after a period of preliminary
training in South Africa, joined the 21st Brigade under
General Bruce Hamilton. After continuous marching for
about fifty days the Battalion reached Pretoria on the 5th
June, and on the 12th June fought in the battle of Diamond
Hill.</p>

<p>An interesting impression of the effect they produced on that
occasion was furnished in a speech made at a public gathering
by an officer commanding a squadron of the Royal Horse Guards
present on the field:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“We were drawn up,” he said, “on the flank of the line at the
foot of the hill, when word came down to us that the City Imperial
Volunteers were advancing to attack. With great interest we
watched through our glasses to see how volunteers would act in
coming into action. They came over the brow of the hill in excellent
formation, pressing forward as steadily as at a review. ‘Why!’
we exclaimed, ‘You can’t tell them from Regulars!’”</p></blockquote>

<p>So impressed was the speaker that he determined then and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
there that if ever he had the chance he would command a battalion
of Volunteers.</p>

<h3>1900.</h3>

<p>The City Imperial Volunteers returned home in November,
and were given a tumultuous welcome as they marched through
London on the afternoon of Saturday, the 21st November.
The route was lined by all the Metropolitan Volunteer Battalions;
and so enthusiastic was London to welcome its “heroes”
that it was with the greatest difficulty that the route could be
kept clear.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Lord Albemarle had been attacked with
fever at Cape Town and was unable to embark, thereby missing
the welcome accorded to his Battalion.</p>

<p>The returned warriors of the Civil Service were entertained
by the rest of the Regiment at a great banquet given in their
honour in the King’s Hall, Holborn, on the 10th December.</p>

<p>In all 136 members of the Corps served in South Africa,
principally in the Yeomanry. Of these five were killed or died
in hospital.</p>

<p>Trooper A. E. Trembath (Imperial Yeomanry) earned the
D.C.M., and was promoted to rank of Lieutenant for distinguished
service in action.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">5</a>
Lieutenant Trembath was killed in 1915 whilst serving with the 1st
Battalion in France.</p></div>

<p>As the country was denuded of troops in this year the Government
decided to establish Emergency Camps of Militia and
Volunteers during the summer months. Brigade Camps lasting
for a month were formed, and each Corps was requested to keep
fifty per cent. of its strength in attendance for the whole period.</p>

<p>The South London Brigade consisting of</p>

<p class="table">
2nd (South) Middlesex<br />
7th Middlesex (London Scottish)<br />
12th Middlesex (Civil Service)<br />
13th Middlesex (Queen’s Westminsters)<br />
20th Middlesex (Artists)<br />
</p>

<p>went into camp on Farnborough Common from the 7th July
to the 7th August. The Civil Service was by far the strongest
battalion in attendance, and at its Inspection held on Saturday,
the 21st July, the Battalion, including one Company of the
25th (Bank of England), stood over 1,000 on parade.</p>

<p>Permission was obtained this year to increase the establishment
of the Battalion by two Companies and the maximum
strength to 1,000. The two new Companies were “F”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
Company, recruited from the clerical staff of the London County
Council, and “I” Company, formed of cyclists.</p>

<h3>1901. Field Army Brigades.</h3>

<p>On the 22nd January, 1901, Her Majesty Queen Victoria
died. The Regiment was informed in due course that the
King would honour it by continuing to retain the position of
Honorary Colonel.</p>

<p>In April, 1901, the Regiment lost its Commanding Officer
by the promotion of Lieutenant-Colonel the Earl of Albemarle
to the command of the Norfolk Volunteer Infantry Brigade.
Colonel Tytheridge, who had temporarily commanded during
the absence of Lord Albemarle in South Africa, now succeeded
to the command.</p>

<p>The experience of the South African war had forcibly impressed
the country with the fact that in the Volunteer Force
it possessed an asset deserving of greater encouragement and
development than it had hitherto obtained. As a result of this
feeling, the higher military authorities issued new and more
stringent conditions of efficiency in an endeavour to bring the
backward Corps up to the general level.</p>

<p>Regimental Camps of Instruction were now abolished and
replaced by Brigade Camps. The Old Deer Park, Richmond,
where the Battalion had encamped for nineteen years in succession
(1880 to 1898) was to harbour it no more. Easter Manœuvres,
Whitsuntide Marching Columns, Aldershot Provisional
Battalions, Clacton Seaside Engineering Camps all dropped
out; and energies were concentrated on securing a maximum
muster at the Brigade Camp, where it was necessary to maintain
an attendance of half the full strength (500) for the period of
fourteen days in order to earn the War Office grant.</p>

<p>The position in which the Regiment might find itself in the
event of a national emergency had long been a subject of uncertainty
and doubt.</p>

<p>The Treasury had firmly expressed themselves on this point
in a Minute issued in 1899 and published in Regimental Orders,
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Volunteer Force was primarily formed for Home Defence,
and there seems special objections to a regiment like the Civil
Service Rifles serving abroad. The men have their public duties
to perform at home, and if they were sent abroad, untried men
must be temporarily employed in their places for the performance
of Civil Service professional work.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p></blockquote>

There is no doubt that if it had not been for this attitude adopted by
the Treasury and firmly maintained up to 1914, and the hampering effect
it had upon Regimental authorities, the Civil Service would have been
found in that fateful year among the first of the Territorial battalions on
the field of war.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<p>The Battalion, nevertheless, was selected as one of those to
be placed in the “Field Army Brigades” which were formed
under the new scheme of Home Defence. At first it was placed
in the 24th (Volunteer) Brigade, consisting of 2nd (South)
Middlesex, 12th Middlesex (Civil Service), 21st Middlesex, and
4th (Volunteer Battalion) Royal West Surrey Regiment.</p>

<p>Camp was formed this year at Jubilee Hill, Aldershot, under
the Officer Commanding the District.</p>

<h3>1903.</h3>

<p>In 1903 Brigades were re-organised, and the Civil Service, with
the Queen’s Westminsters, London Irish and 2nd London
formed the 23rd Brigade under Colonel Jerrard. This officer
held training camps as follows:</p>

<p class="table">
1903.&mdash;Shorncliffe.<br />
1904 and 1905.&mdash;Sway (New Forest).<br />
1906.&mdash;Shorncliffe.<br />
</p>

<p>About this time the Regiment effected certain changes in
its uniform with the view of making it more suitable for work
in the field. The helmet was altered to a shape which was
perhaps less artistic, but gave greater comfort, and had not
the disadvantage possessed by its predecessor of disabling the
wearer from shooting when lying down. The tunic or jacket
was made much looser and contained serviceable pockets.
Puttees were adopted in lieu of gaiters, and enamelled belts
were discarded in favour of dull black leather.</p>

<p>Altogether it now formed a very serviceable yet attractive
uniform. Its invisibility at a distance was remarkable, and
was the subject of frequent remark by distinguished foreign
officers attending manœuvres.</p>

<h3>1902.</h3>

<p>Captain B. J. Majendie, King’s Royal Rifles, was appointed
Adjutant in November, 1902, <i>vice</i> Major Lamb, retired. Captain
Majendie’s experiences in the South African war had been
somewhat unique and unfortunate. Whilst accompanying
a troop of cavalry sent out as a patrol from Ladysmith on the
day that war was declared, the party were surrounded and
captured by the enemy and held prisoners in Pretoria until
that place was taken by General Roberts in the following year.
Captain Majendie was the first Adjutant which the Corps had
secured from the regular regiment of which it formed a Volunteer
battalion; and by his efforts and instruction the Battalion
became “riflemen,” and adopted rifle drill and customs. But
the fact that officers were always trained at the Guards’ Schools
of Instruction, where the drill of the rifleman is unknown, was a
drawback to this arrangement.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p>In 1902, Major and Honorary Lieutenant-Colonel Danter,
who had been appointed Major in 1897, resigned through bad
health. The Battalion owed much to Colonel Danter for his
hard and brilliant work for many years. To his energy and
leadership in their early years may be mainly attributed the
successes which the Regiment were now securing in its signalling
section and in the School of Arms.</p>

<h3>School of Arms.</h3>

<p>To the latter institution a word is now due. Ever since the
Headquarters had been opened, the athletic youth of the public
offices in London had been attracted to this excellent training
school in their midst. During the winter months the building
was thronged to overflowing on “School” nights with perspiring
youth in flannels, as class after class followed each other in
unceasing relays for hours. Organising, directing and instructing
this untiring energy were Danter, Brett, W. H. D. Clarke,
Whitehurst, Weeks, Bell, Kirkby and others, ably supported, of
course, by the most skilled instructors that the Guards and
Aldershot could supply.</p>

<p>The result had now become apparent in the wonderful series
of successes the School achieved, not only in the Home District
Tournaments, but at the Royal Military Tournaments in competition
with the Navy and Army.</p>

<p>A list of winners of Challenge cups and championship and
silver medallists is given in Appendix No. V.</p>

<p>In addition to these successes, the School of Arms obtained
39 second and 18 third prizes at the R.M. Tournament, and
an even greater number of prizes at the competitions of the
Metropolitan Territorial School of Arms Association.</p>

<p>The most successful period for the Regimental School was
during the first decade of the present century, when those fine
all-round athletes Hobbins, Marsh and Chalke were in the
hey-day of their prowess, and Major Brett, the oldest man in the
competitions of 1907, won the Officers’ Bayonet Challenge Cup.</p>

<p>In the previous year the Regimental Officers’ Team won the
Inter-Regimental Bayonet Fighting Cup, beating the R.M.A.,
with its large complement of officers to select from, in the final.
This was the only occasion on which the Cup was wrested from
the Regulars or Navy.</p>

<p>The Light-Weight Tug-of-War Team in 1904 became the
permanent possessors of the R.M.T. Cup, which they had won
three times in four years.</p>

<h3>“Daily Telegraph” Cup.</h3>

<p>In 1902 the Corps secured an honour for which it had striven
for many years, and which, although as a rule honourably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
placed in the strenuous competition, it had never yet succeeded
in obtaining. This was the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> Cup for
marching and shooting, competed for at the Home District Rifle
Meeting by teams from most of the battalions of regulars and
volunteers in the district. And now, under the leadership of
Captain F. J. Brett, supported by Sergeant W. H. D. Clarke,
it was won four years in succession, a feat never performed by
any other battalion.</p>

<h3>1904.</h3>

<p>In 1904, Colonel Tytheridge resigned and the Earl of Arran,
late Captain, Royal Horse Guards, was appointed Commanding
Officer. Captain and Hon. Major E. Merrick and Captain R. G.
Hayes were promoted Field Officers.</p>

<p>At the end of 1906 the Field Army Brigades were abolished,
as preparations were then being made for a much greater call
upon volunteers than that entailed by the existing scheme of
Home Defence.</p>

<p>Troubled by the incessant cry for economy in military expenditure
from their supporters on one side and the imminence
of a European war with insufficient military strength on the
other, the Government turned again to the Volunteer Force
for aid.</p>

<h3>The Territorial and Reserve Forces Act, 1907.</h3>

<p>The Territorial and Reserve Forces Act was passed in 1907,
by which the Force might at once become an integral part of
the Army on a threat of war.</p>

<p>The Brigade Camp of 1907 held at West Tarring, near Worthing,
was therefore the last camp of the Civil Service Volunteers.
Before the summer training camps of 1908 were formed, the
Corps had been disbanded and re-enrolled, the grey uniform had
been discarded, and a new khaki-clad battalion of Territorial
soldiers of the King, 800 strong, stood ready to ask His Majesty
to be again their Honorary Colonel. The request was granted,
and the <i>London Gazette</i> announced that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“His Majesty the King has been graciously pleased to signify
his royal pleasure that he will continue to remain Honorary Colonel
of the Corps on its transfer to the Territorial Force.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The transfer throughout the Force was not made without
difficulty or without great effort on the part of its leaders.
Much nervousness existed as to the liabilities to be incurred
under the Act, the additional claim upon a man’s spare time,
the suggested penalties in case of default, etc. The efforts of
the leaders were not assisted by the singularly inept methods
of the military authorities. The Act provided that the Volunteer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
should be re-attested on entering the new Force. The Attestation
Form at first issued by the War Office contained a long
list of questions to be answered by the recruit. Prominent
across the face of the form was the statement:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“You are hereby warned that if it is found that you have given
a false answer to the following questions you will be liable to imprisonment
with hard labour.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In this grateful and tactful manner it was proposed to greet
the patriotic citizen on taking the first step towards his additional
burden. But the protests of Volunteer Commanders
were loud and the obnoxious form was quickly withdrawn.</p>

<h3>15th (Co. of London) Battalion, 4th London Brigade.</h3>

<p>The Battalion, under the title of the “15th (County of London)
Battalion the London Regiment,” was placed in the 4th London
Brigade of the 2nd London Division, the brigade being constituted
as before (the old “Grey Brigade”), and still under
the Lieutenant-Colonel commanding the Scots Guards Regiment.</p>

<p>The first training camp of the Territorial Brigade was held at
West Down, Salisbury Plain, from August 2nd to 16th, 1908,
Colonel Inigo Jones, Scots Guards, in command. The Civil
Service were by far the strongest battalion in the camp; the
London Scottish and other corps having as yet been able to
raise but a few companies for the new Force. This result had
been achieved in spite of the fact that Treasury Regulations
had been issued, regarding leave to be granted to Territorials
in Government Departments for camp training, in which the
conditions were much less generous than those formerly accorded
to volunteers by Heads of Departments.</p>

<p>Fortunately, an officer of the Corps, Lieutenant F. H. D.
Acland, having been elected M.P. for Richmond (Yorks), had
been given the post of Parliamentary Secretary to the War
Office. By his influence the Secretary of State for War, Mr.
Haldane, commenced a tour of inspection of Territorials by
visiting the camp at Salisbury Plain and lunching with the
“Civil Service.” On his attention being drawn to the new leave
conditions, Mr. Haldane was good enough to attend the Regimental
Prize Distribution at the close of the year and publicly
announced that more generous conditions should be issued.</p>

<h3>1908.</h3>

<p>In August, 1908, the Earl of Arran found himself compelled,
with regret, to resign the command. Notwithstanding the fact
that his former military experience had been entirely that of a
cavalry officer, Lord Arran had, by his personal efforts, kept up
the high standard of steadiness and efficiency in drill to which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
the Battalion had attained, and his popularity as a Commanding
Officer had never been exceeded by any. It was with sorrow
that every member of the Corps heard of his decision to resign.</p>

<p>The command was taken over temporarily for a few months
by Major and Hon. Lieutenant-Colonel Merrick, who, then in his
thirty-third year of service, declined to allow his name to be put
forward for further promotion. In December, 1908, the regiment
found in Major the Hon. C. S. H. D. Willoughby, late of the Scots
Guards, a Commanding Officer admirably qualified to lead it
through the period of preparation for more serious military work
which was now before it as a battalion of the Territorial Force.</p>

<p>In the change from a unit of the loosely-organized mass of
Infantry and Garrison Artillery which constituted the Volunteer
Force, to that of a strictly regulated battalion of the new
Territorial Army (with its Brigade and Divisional Staffs, its due
proportion of Cavalry, Field Artillery and Transport) the Corps
had been trimmed and shorn of many of its former privileged
adjuncts. Its establishment of officers was considerably reduced,
and with great regret it lost its Honorary Chaplain, the Rev.
Canon Duckworth. Canon Duckworth had served the Corps
loyally for 23 years. He took great pride in never being a
“non-efficient,” was always on parade at the annual inspection,
and wherever the regiment was encamped its Chaplain never
failed to appear on the middle Sunday to conduct the service and
preach his annual sermon.</p>

<p>The Battalion also lost its two bands, and its company of
cyclists was abolished.</p>

<p>The drills and camp trainings required were not as extensive
as those afforded by the Corps under Volunteer conditions; but
this was amply compensated for by the benefit derived, especially
by officers, from the training given by Brigade and Divisional
Staffs.</p>

<p>Instructional tours, in which officers of Cavalry, Artillery,
Infantry and Transport met, took place frequently to important
military positions in the neighbourhood of London. In these
the Division (<i>minus</i> the men) would move by Manœuvre Orders
duly issued by Divisional, Brigade and other Commanders of
units, billet or bivouac on positions previously inspected and
reported upon, throw out outposts, resume column of route,
move on to the battle position and engage the enemy in the
neighbourhood of Dunstable, Canterbury or other place selected.
In its early days the 2nd London Division on these occasions had
the advantage of the admirable instruction of Colonel Stanley
Maude (afterwards General Sir Stanley Maude) as chief of the
staff.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<h3>1910.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">7</a>
From this point to the outbreak of war the annals are continued by
Captain Bell, late Civil Service Rifles.</p></div>

<p>The commencement of the training year saw the duties of
Adjutant taken over by Captain Fitzclarence of the Royal
Fusiliers, an officer of wide experience and one who had had
some previous knowledge of the working of a force recruited
under the voluntary system. From his first appearance on
parade his popularity was assured, and he ably seconded the
efforts made by Colonel Willoughby to bring the regiment up
to a high state of efficiency.</p>

<p>Training during the year followed the usual course. The
Easter training was carried out at Windsor, and the Annual
Training Camp at Minster-on-Sea was of an exceptionally
interesting nature. In the opinion of many it represented the
ideal camp training for the Territorial Force, consisting as it
did of practical musketry and field manœuvres, winding up
with an extensive trek through the pleasant lanes of northern
Kent. A most enjoyable fortnight was spent, and the members
of the Battalion returned at the end of it to their everyday
avocations feeling satisfied that they had made some real progress
towards fitting themselves to fulfil the duties for which
the Territorial Force was intended. The Brigadier gave expression
to his views on the following terms:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Brigadier wishes to thank all ranks of the Brigade for
their loyal co-operation and unflagging zeal and keenness during
the Annual Camp this year, more especially during the week’s
bivouac and hard marching, which was a severe test to untrained
troops and in which the Brigade acquitted itself to his entire satisfaction.
He attributes this success in a great measure to the fine
spirit and soldierlike pride which has ever distinguished the Grey
Brigade, and has once again successfully brought it through a
trying time. He hopes and thinks that, though the work has been
hard, the results have been great, and that all ranks are more fitted
to take their part in active service should the necessity arise.”</p></blockquote>

<p>A Regimental Athletic Club was formed with the twofold
object of securing the best possible representation in the Territorial
Sports and Marathon Race held annually in June and of
fostering athletics from a military standpoint throughout the
Battalion. The Committee did valuable work, and as the
result of its labours the Regimental Team was enabled to take
a high place in the Marathon Race.</p>

<p>This year the Regiment had to mourn the loss of its Honorary
Colonel, His Majesty King Edward VII. He had been associated
with the regiment over the long period of fifty years.</p>

<p>Major R. B. Hughes, who had been Quartermaster to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
Battalion since the early nineties, was compelled, much to his
regret, to resign his appointment this year. The regiment felt
at his departure a regret equal to his own. Quartermaster-Sergeant
W. H. D. Clark succeeded him, and the ability and
hard work which he put into the arrangements for the Annual
Camp contributed in no small degree to the success of that
outing.</p>

<p>The announcement that the Regiment had been honoured
by the appointment of the Rev. Canon Herbert Hensley Henson,
D. D., as its Chaplain was received with gratification by the
Battalion. Canon Henson had been approached because his
church&mdash;St. Margaret’s, Westminster&mdash;is regarded as the church
of Parliament and the Civil Service.</p>

<h3>1911.</h3>

<p>The Easter Training this year took place at the Guards’ Depot
at Caterham. The opportunity thus afforded to the officers and
non-commissioned officers of the Battalion to see the course
of instruction through which a recruit of the Regular Army
had to pass was most valuable.</p>

<p>The Battalion was called on to furnish a number of detachments
in connection with the Coronation festivities this year,
and acquitted itself well throughout. The Major-General in
command of the Division expressed his entire satisfaction with
the way in which the various duties were performed. As the
personal gift of His Majesty on the occasion of his coronation,
the Coronation Medal was awarded to the Commanding Officer,
the Officers Commanding the detachments, the Quartermaster,
Regimental Sergeant-Major, the senior N.C.O. and senior
Private.</p>

<p>Annual training in camp took place at Dover. The political
situation at home and abroad was not all that might be desired,
and amongst all ranks was the feeling that before the camp
terminated the Battalion might be called on for more serious
work than that usually carried out on these occasions. Not
until the Battalion had entrained for return to London could it
be said that the tension had relaxed. The Major-General in
his remarks on the training said that he noticed with pleasure
the very good work done by all units, work which showed a
distinct advance on any previously performed. He referred to
the satisfaction given him by the cheerful way in which hardships,
which resulted from the unavoidable stoppage of railway
transport, had been borne by all ranks.</p>

<p>The Regiment furnished a detachment consisting of 1 officer,
1 N.C.O. and 4 men to attend the investiture of H.R.H. the
Prince of Wales at Carnarvon on July 13th, 1911.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>

<p>The efforts put forth by the Regimental Sports Club in connection
with the annual Marathon Race only just failed of
success, the Battalion team finishing second.</p>

<h3>1912.</h3>

<p>This year saw the old pattern Slade-Wallis equipment replaced
by the Mills web equipment. The change was much
appreciated and every one felt that with the supply of the new
pack and haversack it was no longer necessary to rely for essentials
on the kit-bag, and that, as a consequence, the mobility of
the Battalion was greatly increased.</p>

<p>A feature of the year was the Whitsuntide outing arranged
at Bisley for the purpose of drill and musketry. The detachment
was favoured by good weather and had the opportunity
of firing under the most favourable conditions all the practices
laid down for the annual course.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Colonel Willoughby, who had been in command of the Regiment
since 1908, was appointed to the command of the 6th
Infantry Brigade on May 14th, 1912, and was succeeded by
Major R. G. Hayes. Colonel Willoughby during his period of
command had endeared himself to all ranks, and the Regiment
parted with him with sincere regret. He issued a Farewell
Order in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In relinquishing his official connection with the Regiment,
Colonel Willoughby desires to thank the Officers, N.C.O.’s and men
for their loyal co-operation and constant support they have so
freely rendered him throughout the period that it has been his
privilege to command the Battalion.”</p></blockquote>

<p>A further loss to the Battalion was that of Major F. J. Brett,
who resigned on April 27th, 1912. “Freddie’s” honours and
achievements in the world of sport would fill a book by themselves.
He was the life and soul of the Regimental School of
Arms and his successes in bayonet fighting, fencing, etc., will
long be remembered. His success in winning, in the year 1907,
at the age of forty-six, the individual Bayonet Fighting Competition
at the Royal Military Tournament is one which it can
safely be said will never be equalled.</p>

<p>The practice of having the Easter training at the Guards
Depot at Caterham had now become established, and the welcome
which was always given the detachment there made the outing
one to be looked forward to. The annual training in camp
took place this year at Frith Hill, Aldershot, and was notable
for the inclement weather experienced. The incessant rain
may, however, have been a blessing in disguise, inasmuch as it
prevented the rations being smothered with the black sand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
peculiar to this locality. Despite the unpleasant conditions,
the troops kept remarkably free from illness. A feature of
the training was Brigade movements in close formation, and
it was a matter of no little astonishment to all ranks to see
how easily and without confusion large bodies of well-organised
and disciplined troops could be moved over rough and uneven
ground. On the return of the Battalion from camp, the following
extract from a War Office letter was published in Regimental
Orders:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Army Council have expressed their appreciation and that
of the Secretary of State for War for the excellent spirit which was
shown by the Territorial troops in camp this year. The weather
has been most inclement and the soldierly spirit in which the troops
bore their discomforts was most praiseworthy.”</p></blockquote>

<h3>1913.</h3>

<p>A review of the London District Territorial Troops by His
Majesty the King took place in Hyde Park on July 5th, 1913.
The Battalion was well represented.</p>

<p>The annual camp was held this year at Abergavenny in
South Wales. The Battalion had never before been called on
to proceed so far afield for its training, and the visit to Wales
was looked forward to with eager anticipation. The Brigade
arrived at Abergavenny on Sunday, July 27th, and soon got
to work on the programme laid down. The first week was
devoted to section, company and battalion training, and on
the Monday in the second week all surplus canvas was struck
and a week’s trek commenced. The first day’s march brought
the Battalion via Crickhowell to Glanusk Park, where a bivouac
was formed. Many members of the Battalion were glad of
the opportunity thus afforded to renew acquaintance with Lord
Glanusk, an acquaintance first formed while he was Adjutant of
the City Imperial Volunteers and maintained during his tenure of
command of the Guards Depot at Caterham. On the following
day the march was resumed, and the Battalion reached “The
Forest,” via Tretower and Cwm-du. Wednesday saw the
Battalion <i>en route</i> for Tal-y-maes, encountering on its way an
opposing force at the Pass of Rhin Truman. The pass was
forced and the troops eventually reached their camp at Tal-y-maes,
situated amongst some of the finest scenery in Wales.
There Battalion and Brigade manœuvres were carried out for
a couple of days, after which the return to Abergavenny was
commenced and the old quarters reached at the end of the
week. The Brigade returned to London on Sunday, August 10th,
well satisfied that the military authorities had succeeded in
combining an enjoyable holiday with a considerable amount of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
military training. A tribute to the popularity of the conception
can be found in the fact that out of a battalion 779
strong, 735 attended the camp.</p>

<h3>1914.</h3>

<p>All other events of the year 1914 were dwarfed by the outbreak
of the war with the Central Powers and the embodiment
of the Territorial Force. As every one recollects, the call was
sudden. The Battalion was carrying out the programme laid
down for its peace training, and had actually arrived at Perham
Down Camp, Salisbury Plain, for its annual camp training.
Its stay there was but short&mdash;in fact, only a matter of hours&mdash;and
it found itself back in London within twenty-four hours of
having left it. The mobilization arrangements which had not
long before been tested under the supervision of the Brigadier
worked well, and a time of busy preparation set in.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> At the
outset the Battalion received with astonishment the news that
the Government had decided that members of the Civil Service
called up on embodiment would not be allowed their civil pay,
and would have to depend entirely on their Army pay of their
rank plus the usual allowances. It was felt that a decision
such as this would interfere greatly with the efforts made to
fill up the gaps in the Regiment, and would make difficult the
provision of the necessary reserve of men. Representations were
at once made to the Prime Minister, Captain Parish, the Adjutant,
even going so far as to interview him on the subject before he
had breakfasted on the morning following the announcement.
The Prime Minister agreed to have the matter further considered,
and the result was so far satisfactory that the flow of
recruits continued.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">8</a>
“We went to Somerset House and dismissed, but assembled again on
the Tuesday, and on Wednesday we were mobilised. The battalion of 800
odd were accommodated in the corridors of Somerset House, and we fed &agrave;
la picnic in the square.”&mdash;<i>Extract from letter dated Feb. 5th, 1915.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<p>The Battalion commenced its move to its war station in the
neighbourhood of Watford on August 11th, bivouacked at
Edgware for the night, and continued the march the following
day. The troops stood the trying march well. The Battalion
took up its quarters in and around the village of Bedmond and
remained there until early in November, when it moved into
billets in the town of Watford. A number of changes in personnel
took place. Colonel the Earl of Arran, a former Commanding
Officer of the Regiment, was given command of the Battalion,
Lieutenant-Colonel Hayes being appointed to the command of the
second line. The news of Lord Arran’s appointment was received
with great gratification, and every one present on parade in
the little park at Bedmond on the day on which he joined the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
Battalion will remember the stirring and inspiring words in
which he addressed them, winding up his remarks by stating
in a very determined way that, “We have a long way to go,
but we are going to get there.” To the great regret of the
whole Battalion Lord Arran was obliged later on to relinquish the
command to rejoin his old regiment, the Royal Horse Guards.
His place was taken by Colonel Renny, late of the Indian Army,
and under him the Battalion moved to France on March 17th,
1915.

<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>A few words on the manner in which the story of the 1st
Battalion was written will not be out of place, and may help
to explain the delay in producing the book and the obvious
errors of omission which have been committed.</p>

<p>When the Battalion went to France two diaries were kept at
headquarters&mdash;the War Diary, in which were recorded all the
military exploits of the Battalion, and the Regimental Diary,
which contained all the “personal gossip” in the Regiment,
as well as accounts of tours in the front line. This Regimental
Diary was started by Capt. Parish, who was then Adjutant,
with the idea that it should be printed and published at the
end of the war. But owing to frequent changes in the personnel
of Battalion Headquarters, the book was not kept up to date,
and there are, in consequence, several big gaps in its pages.
It was finally closed early in 1918, when Colonel Segrave decided
that as the keeping of two diaries entailed a certain amount of
duplication of work, the War Diary should, in future, be a
complete record of the history of the Battalion. From that
time, therefore, the War Diary contained every item of interest
to the Battalion, including such details as the names of the
members of football teams and the artistes at Battalion concerts.</p>

<p>With these two books, therefore, I began in the winter of
1919 to collect material for a history. A committee was formed,
on which I tried to get a representative of each Company and
Specialist Section, and here I should like to acknowledge my
indebtedness to these gentlemen, each one of whom has taken
an active interest in the preparation of the book:&mdash;R. H. Burden,
D.C.M., R. G. Callingham, S. L. Clements, E. Cooke, D.C.M.,
C. Ibbett, M.M., F. A. Lewis, M.M., R. H. Maddocks, F. C.
Robertson, D.C.M., G. M. Sladden and R. C. Sugars, D.C.M.</p>

<p>In addition C.S.M. T. P. Brett, M.C., and Sergeant C. M. A.
Tucker were kind enough to place at my disposal a book of
notes, letters, and extracts from private diaries which they
had collected, dealing with the first year of the career of the
Battalion in France. Sergeant Tucker has been most energetic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
throughout in his efforts to collect further material and to
improve the crude story which I presented to the committee.</p>

<p>The story was written in instalments and so read to the
committee, who criticised it and amended it, and it was then
typed by Sergeant Tucker. The typed copy was then circulated
among different members of the committee, who suggested
further amendments, and the result is now presented to the
Regiment as a simple record of the outstanding features of life
in the 1st Civil Service Rifles in France.</p>

<p>I am fully conscious that there are grave omissions, notably in
respect to paragraphs of appreciation of individuals. There are
many more members deserving of special mention than appear in
these pages, but I have included all who were brought to my
notice and who, in my opinion, played a prominent part in the
success of the Battalion. At the same time there are some
whom I have missed, and to avoid doing these an injustice it
was at one time suggested that all references to individuals
should be cut out, but there are some who played such a big
part in our history that no story of the Battalion would be
nearly complete without mention of them.</p>

<p>As to the literary style and arrangement of the book, I am
told by one of my critics that it is dull and lifeless, and that the
descriptions of battles are not sufficiently picturesque. My only
reply is that I have aimed at an accurate description rather than
at a highly coloured style, and I hope my critics will bear in
mind that, prior to this effort, I have never attempted anything
more ambitious in the literary line than a love letter.</p>

<p>In addition to members of the committee the following members
of the Regiment have very kindly written contributions:&mdash;G.
C. G. Andrews, C. E. Bassett, E. De Ath, C. N. Burdock,
C. Manthorpe, L. C. Morris, M.C., V. Stewart, J. H. Swain,
and W. G. Skillern. To these gentlemen I should like to express
my grateful appreciation.</p>

<span class="medium">“17TH OF MARCH MEN”</span></h2>

<p>At the annual dinner in London on St. Patrick’s Day the survivors
of those who constituted the original 1st Battalion of
the Civil Service Rifles commemorate the historic day on which
the Regiment first sent a Battalion on active service&mdash;the 17th
of March, 1915.</p>

<p>It was hardly realised when that Battalion went to France
that it would soon become the highest of distinctions in the
Regiment to be described as a “17th of March man,” but this
distinction is fully recognised now, and he is a much envied man
who has the right to attend the Annual Commemoration Dinner.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">10</a>
This dinner was instituted on the 17th March, 1916, in the
Reserve Battalion Camp at Hazeley Down, Winchester, where
already a number of the originals who had been wounded, had returned.
To Captain G. C. Grimsdale fell the honour of taking the
chair at the first of these functions, which it was decided should
be held annually so long as any “17th of March men” should live
to attend them.</p></div>

<p>There were about 1,100 all ranks who, after eagerly awaiting,
during seven long months of training, the summons to join the
B. E. F. in France, achieved their ambition on St. Patrick’s Day,
1915, and entrained at Watford in the early hours of the morning.
Throughout their stay in Watford, where they had been billeted
since November, 1914, they had received the warmest hospitality,
and it is not surprising, therefore, that their pride in going to
the front was tinged with regret at leaving such good friends.</p>

<p>After a roundabout journey, Southampton was reached at
11.0 a.m., and the Battalion had to confine itself for the rest of
the day to a few hundred yards of quay, impatiently awaiting
embarkation, which was not carried out till dusk. Four boats
were used&mdash;the <i>Balmoral</i>, <i>City of Chester</i>, <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Munich</i>&mdash;boats
used in the piping times of peace for pleasure trips along
the coast. There were no bands playing, no cheering crowds,
but just three or four bored officials, embarkation officers, and
dock policemen. Thus the 1st Civil Service Rifles,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> under the
command of Lieut. Colonel A. M. Renny, left England, having
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
on board the four boats thirty officers, 1,046 other ranks, and
78 horses.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">11</a>
See Appendix for list of officers.</p></div>

<p>In addition, Captain H. B. Farquhar had taken a small
advance party some days earlier.</p>

<p>On the whole the Civil Service Rifles were not favourably
impressed with Havre where the battalion disembarked at
about 9.0 a.m. on the 18th of March, the chief disappointment,
perhaps, being that there were little or no signs of the Great
War. No welcoming crowds of pretty French girls were there
to meet them, and almost unnoticed they marched through the
town and up the hill which led to the camp above Harfleur.
Here the troops, perspiring after the steep climb, in what they
thought was full marching order, learnt that there were many
more things for the unfortunate Infantry soldier to carry in
France. Winter clothing was issued, and although it was very
welcome on that bitterly cold afternoon, the weight of it made
everyone look forward with more than usual keenness to the
coming of Spring.</p>

<p>A bitterly cold night was spent in the tents, and at 3.0 p.m.
on the following day, the Battalion made its first acquaintance
with the troop trains of the B. E. F.&mdash;the men’s compartments
of which bore the now familiar legend:&mdash;</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Chevaux (en long)</td>
    <td class="tdr">8</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Hommes</td>
    <td class="tdr">37-40</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Lieutenant A. Roberts and fifty-nine other ranks had to be
left behind as a first reinforcement&mdash;an arrangement made by
a thoughtful G. H. Q. to ensure that the whole of the Civil
Service Rifles should not be wiped out in their first battle.</p>

<p>After a most wearisome journey, lasting twenty-four hours,
the Battalion detrained at the little station of Berguette.</p>

<p>The march from Berguette to the billets in the village of
Cauchy a la Tour was an ordeal never to be forgotten by those
who suffered it. Fifteen miles on pav&egrave; roads, in full marching
order with a blanket in addition, tested to the uttermost men
who were already fatigued by the extreme discomfort of the
cattle train. But Cauchy was reached, without loss, at midnight,
and to the consternation of all ranks, no trace could be
found of the billeting party or of the billets. This was indeed
a bitter blow to the exhausted troops, who settled down in the
main street, and began to wonder whether they had to march
still further, for there were no signs of life in Cauchy. The
situation was eventually saved by waking up M. le Maire, on
whom, it is said, Lieutenant Carlisle so successfully tried his
French that billets were found after the Battalion had been
waiting in the road for two hours. Some say the straw was
clean, others say it was otherwise, but it mattered little that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
night. Any place was good enough, provided the troops could
be left to sleep in peace.</p>

<p>It is believed that after the billeting party had left Havre,
the destination of the 47th Division was changed, and the Civil
Service Rifles were already at St. Omer before any message
reached the billeting party, who did not arrive at Cauchy until
about twenty-four hours after the Battalion was billeted.</p>

<p>The Battalion trained, somewhat impatiently, for three whole
weeks at Cauchy a la Tour. The troops, it must be admitted,
were bored with it, as would appear from the following
description in a letter home:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The village is in the middle of a flat colliery district. The
northern horizon is filled with great hills of slag from the mines&mdash;like
Egyptian pyramids, whence comes an eternal shrill whistle. The
well in the market square from which we draw our water is 100 feet
deep, and it is difficult to get near the bucket for the crush of civilians
and khaki. The women are mostly fat and sans corsets. They
sell French papers and herald their approach with a toot of a horn.
Mud carts are drawn by dogs. Horses can be seen working treadmills.
The constant stream of motor lorries bringing food stores
to the front passes along the highway. We hear the distant boom
of big guns&mdash;a famous part of the firing line is 18 miles away. But
the preponderant thought with us all is ‘Where is this bloody
war?’”</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 22nd of March, the Battalion was inspected by Field-Marshal
Sir John French, accompanied by General Sir Douglas
Haig and General Sir Chas. Munro. The Commander-in-Chief’s
remark “The men are splendid” was afterwards reproduced in
large type on the Civil Service Recruiting Posters in London
underneath a photograph of Sergeant G. L. Eager, looking very
much at home in a trench.</p>

<p>The first Civil Service Rifles Sports Meeting in France took
place in a small rough field in Cauchy a la Tour, on the afternoon
of the 28th March. The following account of it is taken from
the Regimental Diary:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The events included 500 yards&mdash;winner, Private L. P. Winter,
of ‘D’ Company; 250 yards (Sergeants)&mdash;Sergeant Rathbone (a
dark horse) ‘thrown in’ with 20 yards start; 250 yards (officers)&mdash;Captain
and Adjutant F. W. Parish 1st, Captain W. F. K. Newson
2nd; Second Lieutenant Benk&eacute; 3rd. Inter-Company tug-of-war&mdash;‘A’
Company beat ‘B’ Company on the third pull. Officers three-legged
race&mdash;Second Lieutenants Benk&eacute; and Stevens easy winners.
Lieutenants Chalmers and Carlisle next. Inter-Company team
race (1 officer, 20 other ranks)&mdash;‘B’ Company 1st, ‘D’ Company
2nd. Inspection of Officers’ chargers and also of transport horses
for best turnout; two races of 250 yards for ‘visitors’&mdash;the small
boys of the village who also participated in scrambles for small
change. Obstacle race, where one obstacle proved too much for all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
but six starters&mdash;Lance-Corporal Cocky Oliver 1st; Lance-Corporal
H. Battersby 2nd; Lance-Corporal W. J. Irving 3rd. The Commanding
Officer afterwards distributed prizes to the winners.
Much amusement caused by their nature. We had broken away
from the salad bowl, tea spoon and tobacco cabinets, etc. and
substituted packets of chocolate, tinned fruit, tins of sardines,
box of candles (though Cauchy is illuminated throughout by
electricity), and, for officers, tins of dubbin and bully beef tin
openers.“</p></blockquote>

<p>It may, perhaps, be remarked that all the winners at this
Sports Meeting mentioned in the Regimental Diary have
survived the war&mdash;with the sad exception of Lieutenant R.
Chalmers.</p>

<p>The only other incident of note during the training at Cauchy
was the visit to the Division of the Bishop of London, who,
according to the Regimental Diary, was touring the back areas.
His Lordship preached to the 140th Brigade on the 29th of
March, but the only comment that can be found is that “We
had to wear our heavy packs and were kept waiting for some
time.”</p>

<p>On the last day at Cauchy, the 6th of April, news was received
of the first death in the Battalion on active service. Private W. E.
Little of “D” Company, who had left the Battalion on the 4th,
suffering from cerebro spinal meningitis, having died in hospital
at St. Omer. Thus the 17th of March men had already lost one
man before they reached the firing line.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="medium">GIVENCHY AND FESTUBERT</span></h2>

<p>On the 7th of April the Battalion left for Bethune and the
forward area. The villagers gave the men a very hearty send-off,
for the Civil Service Rifles had thoroughly captured the
hearts of all at Cauchy, who had done their best to f&ecirc;te their
heroes overnight.</p>

<p>After sleepy Cauchy, Bethune was voted top hole. The
shops in the old town were quite Parisian, and every one indulged
in dainty but unsatisfying gateaux and steaming bowls of hot
chocolate. For the <i>bon viveurs</i> there were excellent dinners
in the ancient Hotel du Nord; for the artistic the delicate
traceries in the fine old church.</p>

<p>Bethune already showed some scars of the war, and the
building in which the Battalion was housed, Le College des
Jeunes Filles, had lost most of its windows, but otherwise it
made a comfortable billet. Here Lieutenant A. Roberts arrived
with thirty other ranks from the Base&mdash;evidently O.C. Reinforcements
thought it was high time the Civil Service Rifles suffered
some casualties. On the following day the Civil Service Rifles
made its first acquaintance with the trenches. “A” and “B”
Companies were detailed for working parties in support trenches,
while to “D” Company fell the honour of being the first Civil
Service Rifle Company to go into the front line. It was the
good fortune of the Battalion to be initiated in the mysteries
of trench warfare by the 4th (Guards) Brigade, and the arrangement
was that each Company should go in for twenty-four hours
“under instruction” before the battalion held a section of the
line alone. “D” Company accordingly joined the 2nd Coldstream
and survived their twenty-four hours without loss,
but the first battle casualties in the Battalion were suffered by
“B” Company, who, with “A” Company, were returning
from their working party at Cuinchy, when Privates W. Bartram
and H. H. Russell were wounded by a rifle bullet, which passed
through the thigh of one man and hit the calf of the other.
It is said that the wounded men were deeply concerned on two
accounts&mdash;they had seen no Germans either alive or dead, and
it was pay day and they had not drawn their pay!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

<p>There is no doubt that this first visit to the front line was
productive of a sense of disappointment. War had, till then,
been regarded as a glorious thing, a thing of bugles and flashing
bayonets, of courage in hand-to-hand encounters, and above
all, of excitement. But this first experience showed it to be
a thing of drab monotony, of dull routine, of the avoidance of
being killed, of an invisible enemy. And so the letters of these
days, which were to have been of enthralling interest, were,
instead, just catalogues of the minor duties and details of trench
life. Among them, however, is one that cannot but prove of
subtle humour to the infantryman of later years&mdash;1916 and
onwards. An extract is here reproduced.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“You should see the R.E. out in front mending the barbed wire&mdash;and
when a flare goes up, dropping instantly and looking like sandbags,
to be up and working like mad as soon as darkness ensues
again&mdash;cool beggars they are&mdash;odd bullets flying all the time.”</p></blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, R. W. Softly’s account of the first journey
up to the line would not make the soldier of 1918 envy the man
of 1915:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“‘B’ Company had come provided with all kinds of supplies&mdash;firewood
in abundance&mdash;and tied on to most of the packs was a
‘grand pain.’ Though man may live on bread alone I defy him
to live solely on Army biscuit. We certainly thought we had
reached the limit as beasts of burden, but as we waited at the first
communication trench, some Guardsmen passed by. Instead of
our modest bundles of firewood, they carried enormous tree branches.
Half of them possessed frying pans or braziers, and many of them
carried a pair of rubber trench boots so hung round the neck that
it looked as if they were carrying on their shoulders a limp individual
whose head and trunk were missing. When I add that they also
carried picks and shovels, you will understand if we were inclined
to regard them as a race of supermen as they filed past us in the
setting sun.”</p></blockquote>

<p>An important event was the taking-over by the whole Battalion,
on the 13th of April, of a sector of the line&mdash;the real
thing at last! Here, indeed, was an event to set the many
scribes of the Battalion busy. Of all the experiences of the war,
probably none made such a vivid and lasting impression on all
ranks in the Regiment, and certainly none was more fully
written up by the members as this first tour in the firing line of a
Battalion of the Civil Service Rifles. In the light of after events
in the war, it was a very quiet and peaceful tour, and probably
much the same as the initial experience of many other Battalions,
but it was none the less the realisation of all that these men
had been training for since the outbreak of war, so it is small
wonder that no detail was omitted, so far as the censorship
regulations allowed, from the hundreds of descriptive letters
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
sent home at this time. Probably all of them described how
the Battalion paraded in Bethune (the names of places are
included here, though they were doubtless suitably disguised
in those letters home) in full marching order, wearing greatcoats,
on the afternoon of April 13th, 1915, and marched via
the village of Beuvry to the La Bass&eacute;e Canal, the latter part
of the march being by platoons at 100 yards distance. Here
was the old familiar “artillery formation” in real life at last!</p>

<p>Even the landmarks along the side of the Canal received
their share of attention, and mention is made of the two pontoon
bridges, between which at one point the stiff hind legs of a horse
stuck out of the water, of the broken telegraph wires along the
Canal bank, and of the ruined buildings just short of Windy
Corner, where the mile-long, narrow, winding, brick-paved
communication trenches were entered. These had homely
names&mdash;“Cheyne Walk,” “Battersea Road,” “City Road,”
and the dug-outs had such names as “St. Albans Villa,” “Le
Petit Riche,” “Funland,” and so on.</p>

<p>Of the many trying journeys of an infantry battalion, none
is worse than the “hesitation march” along a communication
trench. The floor of the trench is uneven and is full of holes,
there are numerous obstructions across the top, causing the
weary soldier to go down almost on all fours; there are numerous
momentary halts for no apparent reason, and whenever the
party does seem to get moving, sure enough the cry will come
along, “lost touch in rear.” A few muttered curses as the
troops sink down on the bottom of the trench to await the
word “all up in rear” when another start is made. It is now
found that they have lost touch in front, and the leading men
are going “all out” to catch up.</p>

<p>The communication trench leading to the front line at Givenchy
was apparently no exception to the rule, as will be gathered
from the following account:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It takes half an hour to trudge up to the firing line, and, if in
rear of the platoon, it is exceedingly difficult to keep in touch. No
matter how desperately you strive to catch up, the pack of the man
in front is always just on the point of disappearing round the corner.
Stray shots whizz past from time to time....”</p></blockquote>

<p>The perspiring troops, having negotiated the communication
trench, arrived at last in the front line at Givenchy, and the
Battalion relieved the 1st Herts Regiment in the sector known
officially as B1, but better known as the Duck’s Bill.</p>

<p>The frontage held was about 400 yards, and the front line
was about half a mile in front of Battalion Headquarters and
the Battalion Reserve.</p>

<p>Two Companies, “B” and “D,” occupied the front line,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
and “A” and “C” were in reserve in the ruined houses of
Givenchy on both sides of the canal. The village post office
was used as Battalion Headquarters with the Signal Station in
the cellar.</p>

<p>The tour was a distinctly peaceful and uneventful one, which
later on would scarcely have been mentioned in a letter home,
but the regimental diary describes it in detail and tells how,
after a quiet day, things livened up at night and in the reserve
billets “a curious sound is heard every few seconds&mdash;smack,
smack, as bullets spend themselves on the walls around. These
are probably fired by the Germans at our fellows in the trenches,
and, going high, hit the houses at a height of perhaps ten feet
from the ground. Others, however, are probably fired from
fixed rifles at gaps where we are supposed to pass frequently&mdash;along
the bridge and other places, and a lucky shot might catch
one of us. At nine o’clock we are startled by a tremendous
explosion. It is one of our big guns, nicknamed ‘Little Willie,’
on a railway mounting. It moves along the railway by the
canal, and after firing four or five rounds it wisely goes home.”</p>

<p>The Companies changed round on the second day, and in
the evening of the third day the Battalion was relieved by the
1st Herts Regiment, and returned to the college at Bethune.
The troops now felt they were real soldiers, though doubtless
some were surprised to find that they could spend three days
in the line without seeing a German. The only unpleasant
feature in an otherwise very satisfactory forty-eight hours in
the line was the casualty just before the relief to Private R.
Pulman, of “D” Company, who was badly wounded in the
head by a bullet. Private Pulman died in hospital in Bethune
the following day, and his platoon attended the funeral.</p>

<p>The only other casualties were also in “D” Company&mdash;Sergeant
G. F. Anderson and Private I. Spielman&mdash;both
wounded.</p>

<p>The novelty of front line trenches had not yet worn off, and
having had a not unpleasant taste of trench life, the troops were
quite keen to go in again. So it is recorded that “We had heard
a rumour that after doing our forty-eight hours in the trenches
we were to return to Cauchy, so we are now pleased when we
hear that we are to go again to the trenches to-day (the 19th
of April)”.</p>

<p>The second trip to the line was very much like the first one,
but on the first morning the Battalion lost one who for many
years had served with great distinction. Private A. E. Snellgrove,
of “B” Company, who was killed outright by a bullet
through the head, had been a crack shot in the Regiment as
long ago as the Volunteer days. Although he had left the
Regiment some time before the war, he was one of the first men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
to rejoin in August, 1914. A quiet, modest and unassuming
fellow, Private Snellgrove had many friends in the Regiment,
to whom his death came as a great shock. He was buried in
the Guards’ Cemetery at Givenchy.</p>

<p>The Battalion was holding a section of the line immediately
north of the previous sector, and the area now held included
what was known as the “Keep” at Givenchy. This was an
old farm building with a courtyard in which the Guards had
made a flower bed, which they called St. James’s Park. Here
were regimental badges of various Guards Regiments worked
in box or privet hedging. Not to be outdone, the Civil Service
Rifles planted their crest in privet hedging alongside the others.</p>

<p>Two days in this sector, one day’s respite in billets at Le
Preol, and then two more days in the former sector B1, brought
to a close the first experience of the 140th Infantry Brigade
in holding the front line, for on the 24th of April the Brigade
was relieved and the Civil Service Rifles marched via Beuvry,
Bethune and Chocques to rest billets at the village of La
Beuvri&egrave;re&mdash;a village a little larger than Cauchy and a little
more pleasantly situated.</p>

<p>The village lay between two well-wooded uplands. Companies
were billeted in small farms by the side of main roads
and the men slept warmly on straw of suspicious character.
As often as not there was a pigsty next door. Battalion Headquarters
was in a house in the square next the grey old monastery&mdash;then
used as a hospital. The parade ground was down the
hill over the railway, bounded on one side by a swift-flowing
brook good for a dip after a game of football. A favourite
morning’s training was to steer a way by compass through
the thick undergrowth of a wood, six square miles in area, to
the east of the village.</p>

<p>The troops now felt quite familiar with the trenches, and
were glad to have an opportunity of talking over their experiences
in the comparative comfort of the estaminets. As
there had been no further casualties there was a fairly cheerful
atmosphere to greet the remainder of the first reinforcement&mdash;twenty-eight
N.C.O.’s and men who joined from Havre on the
27th of April. The Battalion had, however, lost a good many
men through sickness&mdash;an outbreak of measles being the chief
cause. Already two officers, Lieutenants Radice and Benk&eacute;,
had returned to England through sickness, and, in addition,
2nd Lieutenant F. J. Smith, “A” Company, was so badly
injured in a football match at La Beuvri&egrave;re on the 2nd of May
against the Post Office Rifles, that he had to return to England.
The loss of Frank Smith was keenly felt in the Battalion, of
which he had been a member since 1906. As a sergeant in “B”
Company he was very popular, both with his brother N.C.O.’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
and with the men. He was a thorough sportsman in every way,
and his appointment to a commission in the Regiment only
about a month before was very popular with all ranks.</p>

<p>It was while at La Beuvri&egrave;re that the Battalion received
for each Company a travelling kitchen. Hitherto cooking had
been done in the camp kettle, or “dixie,” and there had been
very little variety in the meals. After a long march, there was
always a tedious waiting for meals, but the “Company Cooker”
was to revolutionise that, for dinners could be cooked on the
march&mdash;and what is more, they were. So the infantryman
salutes the inventor of the “Company Cooker.”</p>

<p>After nearly a fortnight’s rest the Division went back to war,
and the Civil Service Rifles, pausing for one night in very dirty
reserve billets at the village of Gorre, found themselves on the
9th of May on the fringe, as it were, of the battle of Festubert,
where they were holding the intermediate line of breastworks,
behind the 6th London Regiment.</p>

<p>Although Festubert was not a battle of such magnitude as
the operations of 1916 and later, it was an event of no small
importance at the time. The first attack was delivered on
the 9th of May with the object, ultimately, of gaining the Aubers
Ridge&mdash;which dominates Lille and La Bass&eacute;e. The battle went
on intermittently for some days and in the end was not successful.</p>

<p>But although the Battalion held a kind of “watching brief”
during this battle, recollections of Festubert are not by any
means pleasant. The ground was so marshy that it was impossible
to dig trenches, and the line hereabouts was held by a
series of sandbagged barricades, approached by two roads
(Willow Road and Yellow Road) devoid of any kind of cover.
Having negotiated these roads, the men of the front line of
barricades were little, if any, better off than those in support
at the so-called Welsh Chapel, while the Reserve Company
“billets” between Welsh Chapel and Le Plantin could not be
called healthy.</p>

<p>It was at Festubert that the Battalion first became acquainted
with the realities of war, and although the men were employed
practically throughout in holding the line, burying the dead,
and on working and carrying parties, with a little patrol work
thrown in, there were many gallant deeds done, and at the same
time many gallant fellows were lost.</p>

<p>The most vivid impression of Festubert is associated with
the enormous number of dead, who were not only lying about
the ground, but in some places actually formed the barricades.
It was often necessary for the members of burying parties to
wear the primitive gas masks, and it was here that “Paddy”
Brett, the C.S.M. of “D” Company, a man in his forty-third
year, smoked for the first time in his life.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>

<p>The actual number of dead buried by the Civil Service Rifles
in this area is not known, but a very reasonable estimate puts
it at 350 in three days.</p>

<p>The survivors of “B” Company, in particular, have most
unpleasant recollections of the night when they had to crawl
over piles of corpses in order to go forward to occupy an advanced
position.</p>

<p>Among other incidents of Festubert, mention should be made
of the scouting and patrolling done almost nightly by 2nd
Lieutenants W. E. Ind and F. F. Trembath, Sergeant B. K. Ware,
Lance-Corporal G. C. G. Andrews, and Privates R. W. Kelley
and T. Taylor. The work of patrolling No Man’s Land was
not at this time so simple and commonplace as it became later
on, and the patrolling done by these men is mentioned specially,
not because it was the first time it had been done in the
Battalion, but because more than at any other time it was done
in earnest, and was productive of really useful information.</p>

<p>But although the first day of the battle was uneventful so
far as the Civil Service Rifles were concerned, it must not be
imagined that no fighting at all was done at Festubert. For
it was here that the first decorations for gallantry in the field
were awarded to men of the Battalion. On the night of the
25th of May, eight bombers were sent to the assistance of the
Post Office Rifles in an attempt to clear a trench. After a
stubborn fight the position was captured, but of the eight
bombers only four returned alive, and two of these were wounded.
The excellent work of these four was recognised by the award
to each of them of the D.C.M. These were thus the first members
of the Regiment to receive decorations in this war:&mdash;</p>

<p class="table">
Private W. H. Brantom, “B” Co.<br />
Private H. Harris, “A” Co.<br />
Private S. Lawrence, “C” Co.<br />
Private S. W. Mills, “A” Co.<br />
</p>

<p>The four who were killed were Privates W. S. Curtis, “B”
Company; A. J. F. Tracey, “D” Company; P. A. L. Madell,
“D” Company; and A. N. Sharp, “C” Company.</p>

<p>On the same night Lieutenant R. Chalmers, known affectionately
as “Cissie,” was in charge of a working party of “B”
Company digging in No Man’s Land, when he had occasion to
take out a small patrol. He came across a party of bombers
of the Post Office Rifles who were short of bayonet men. Without
a moment’s hesitation, Lieutenant Chalmers picked up a
rifle and bayonet from a man who had become a casualty, and
joining the bombers, rallied them on the parapet to resist an
enemy “rush.” He was soon in the thick of the fight and,
while gallantly leading this party of strangers, he received two
bullet wounds which afterwards proved fatal. Like the unselfish
fellow he had always been, he ordered the stretcher-bearers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
to attend to the other wounded first. When he himself
was afterwards carried back, he died in hospital at the village
of Chocques.</p>

<p>It is difficult indeed to do justice to Lieutenant Chalmers.
He had only just joined the Regiment when war broke out,
but from the first he proved himself a real enthusiast, thoroughly
unselfish, and ever ready to volunteer for any work&mdash;however
unpleasant. He became a great favourite with the N.C.O.’s
and men who served under him, and his death was keenly felt
by his many friends in the Regiment. He had already been
commended by the Commanding Officer for good work in the
front line on three occasions, and his behaviour at the time
when he was mortally wounded was typical of one of the bravest
fellows any Battalion could wish for.</p>

<p>The 25th of May was indeed a bad day for the Battalion for,
in addition to Lieutenant Chalmers and the bombers before
mentioned, many of the stalwarts were killed or wounded on
that day. Captain A. E. Trembath,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> O.C. “C” Company, who
had served with great distinction in the South African War,
was killed in helping one of his wounded officers (Lieutenant F. C.
Olliff). It was an unfortunate affair for “C” Company, who
also lost old friends in Lance-Sergeant J. Smith (killed) and
Lieutenant A. C. Bull (wounded) at the same time. “C”
Company having already lost more than their share of old
stagers in this area could ill afford to lose any of these, and
another who had had long service in the Company was Lance-Corporal
Battersby&mdash;well known for his football and long
distance running&mdash;who was so severely wounded on the 17th
of May that he lost an eye.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">12</a>
Captain Allen Edward Trembath, born 22nd October, 1879, joined
12th Middlesex before the Boer War, transferred to Middlesex Yeomanry,
1899. South Africa mentioned in despatches, D.C.M.; later, wounded and
invalided. Granted commission Middlesex Yeomanry; returned to South
Africa till end of war. 1914 rejoined Civil Service Rifles, later taking a
commission.</p></div>

<p>The “C” Company losses by no means exhaust the
Battalion’s chapter of accidents, for “B” Company lost one of
the finest men in the Battalion in Lance-Corporal G. S. Scarr,
who died on the 26th of May in hospital at Chocques from
wounds received on the previous night. Lance Corporal Scarr
was well known throughout the Battalion for many years for
his pure unselfishness and nobility of character. He was a
man who always played for his side and not for himself.</p>

<p>It was at Chocques, too, that Lieutenant H. R. E. Clark, the
Battalion Machine Gun Officer, died of wounds received on the
24th of May. He had joined the Battalion soon after the
outbreak of war, and had quickly won the confidence and

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
respect of the men whom he led so well. The loss of Lieutenant
Clark was a particularly sad blow for his father, Lieutenant and
Quartermaster W. H. D. Clark, who for many years had been
such an enthusiastic worker for the good of the Regiment. The
hearts of all ranks went out to him in sincere sympathy in his
very sad bereavement.</p>

<p>Amid so many bitter memories it is good to have one incident
of an amusing nature, and the story of the capture by “B”
Company, assisted by a platoon of “D” Company, of what
became known afterwards as “Civil Service Trench,” affords the
one note of comic relief in the dismal story of Festubert. The
gallant charge was led at dead of night by Major H. V. Warrender
(who was then commanding “B” Company), ably supported
by the veteran Robb, who was in charge of the Company Officer’s
Mess. Robb, it is said, was armed with a Primus stove, but it
is not known whether this was meant for a miniature flammenwerfer
attack or whether it was to ensure a hot meal for his
Company Commander on arrival at the objective! Any hopes
of V.C.’s in the Company were doomed to disappointment, for
the trench when reached was found to be deserted, save by
the few corpses that had been left behind. So at last an
operation was undertaken without a casualty, and shortly after
this the merry (!) month of May came to an end, and the
Battalion said good-bye to Festubert&mdash;the land of mud, blood
and stench!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="medium">A “BON WAR”</span></h2>

<p>The inhabitants of the little mining village of Les Brebis displayed
little or no surprise when they were called from their beds
in the middle of the night to greet the Civil Service Rifles on
their arrival from Sailly Labourse&mdash;another mining village
where a peaceful week had been spent after Festubert.</p>

<p>The natives of Les Brebis were now quite accustomed to
being awakened at all hours of the night to receive new lodgers,
for their houses were the billets of the Battalion in reserve to
the front line at Grenay and Maroc, near by.</p>

<p>The heat during the day of the 7th of June had been of the
real midsummer variety, and it was little better at night, when
the march from Sailly Labourse took place. It was not a long
march, but the troops were very thankful when it ended, for
they found their equipment very heavy on that hot June night.</p>

<p>Les Brebis had had a most extraordinary experience during
the war. Here was a village only about two miles from the
front line, practically untouched, and fully inhabited with
civilians who still went about their daily round as in pre-war
times. The mines were still being worked, and an excellent
bathing place was found under the water tower of the electric
light works.</p>

<p>The men were billeted for the first time in France in close
billets, six men on an average sleeping on the small attic floors
of the miners’ cottages. The miners and their families were very
friendly disposed towards the Civil Service Rifles to judge from
the scribe who says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Mesdames were very good to us and cooked the delicacies we
purchased in the town with the utmost care. There was a barrel
of beer in almost every billet, and veal cutlets, cut thin and ‘done
to a turn,’ with pommes de terre frites, egg salad and stewed fruit
made a favourite meal. Indeed, a French housewife, whose mari
was having a hard time in the Vosges on a couple of sous a day
expressed her conviction in a burst of confidence that ‘English
soldat do no work and eat too much.’”</p></blockquote>

<p>The early months of the summer of 1915 were passed very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
pleasantly in this mining district without any event of importance.</p>

<p>The front line was well furnished with various home comforts
taken from the almost deserted village of Maroc, the enemy
was some distance away, there was little shelling and there were
very few casualties. Indeed it was, after Festubert, very much
in the nature of a picnic. No Man’s Land was a field of waving
corn, with scarlet poppies and blue cornflowers to complete the
rural scene. New potatoes and other fresh vegetables, red
currants and gooseberries could be picked in abundance from
the gardens near the trenches, and there are men who claim to
have slipped away from the line to a neighbouring estaminet “to
have a quick one” between their turns of sentry duty in the
line.</p>

<p>The chief enemy was the ferocious fly, which, according to
one victim, “crawled under our clothes, down our backs, between
our eyelids and into our mouths and ears. Over one dug-out a
wit had inscribed Itch Den (Ich Dien) below the Prince of
Wales’s feathers, testifying to the fact that we were now not
only doing our bit but being well bitten in the process.”</p>

<p>More than one scribbler relieved the monotony of trench
routine by recording this phase of the Great War in his diary:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“‘The chief fatigues,’ according to Loxdale, ‘were sand-bagging,
water fetching and dug-out digging, and the game in connection with
them all was to dodge them. This was generally effected by never
being about when fatigues were going. Other methods which still
worked occasionally were preoccupation with imaginary duties,
profound slumber, or serious indisposition at the psychological
moment.’”</p></blockquote>

<p>A night fatigue was humorously described by Beatty as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“To the uninitiated who have only witnessed the carrying of
a plank along the King’s highway, plank-carrying may appear, at
first sight, a very humdrum occupation. But when two men
endeavour to negotiate the twists and turns of a tortuous trench&mdash;some
alliteration, what!&mdash;bearing on their shoulders a 12 ft. plank,
the possibilities are endless.</p>

<p>“It was a beautiful summer night: the stars were starring in
the heavens as is their wont: the poppies on the parapet were gaily
popping and Ebo Smith and I were lying in the trench bottom
wrapped in slumber, overcoats and waterproof sheets.</p>

<p>“Suddenly we were rudely awakened by the raucous voice of
an N.C.O. exclaiming, ‘Five men wanted for fatigue.’ We told him
‘Yes,’ and went to sleep again. But it was no use. He kept on
chanting in a dismal monotone:</p>

<p>“‘Five men from No. 2 are wanted for fatigue,’ and we had
perforce to rise and follow him. After wandering for some distance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
we reached a pile of planks which we had to carry, and this is where
the fun started.</p>

<p>“The diabolical malice of things inanimate is well known. The
propensity for bread-and-butter to fall face downwards on the
best Brussels carpet, and the elusive gambols of the wily collar
stud are everyday occurrences; but for absolutely fiendish cunning
commend me to a 12 ft. plank.</p>

<p>“We had not gone more than one hundred yards along the
trench before my rifle got between my legs and the piling-swivel
caught in my puttee. I, naturally enough, leant the plank on the
parapet and bent down to unfasten my leg. This was the opportunity
for which the plank, having lulled us into a false sense of
security by its apparent docility, was waiting. With diabolical
malice it leapt from the parapet and smote me on the back of the
head. As there were no stretcher-bearers in the neighbourhood I
quickly recovered, and we proceeded on our pilgrimage.</p>

<p>“Ere long we arrived at an exceedingly sharp turn, the projecting
piece being made of sandbags. We were just thinking of
sitting down to discuss the matter when one of the men in the
traverse came to our aid. Poor lad! He didn’t know that plank.</p>

<p>“‘We’ll shove it over the top,’” quoth he! and, seizing one end,
leapt lightly to the top of the pile of sandbags ere we could warn
him.</p>

<p>“His retribution was swift. The pile of sandbags collapsed, our
good Samaritan was hurled through the air, the plank swung round
and hit him on the head, while the avalanche of sandbags buried
Ebo Smith. I dug Ebo out. We thanked our friend, hoped we
hadn’t upset him, and left him seated and thinking deeply amidst
the debris of this ruined traverse.</p>

<p>“Whether the plank had satiated its lust for blood or whether
it was again a case of the triumph of mind over matter, I know not,
but it gave us no more trouble, and we returned to our slumber
glowing with self-satisfaction at the thought of work well done.”</p></blockquote>

<p>These long spells of trench life gave splendid opportunities
for letter writing, and P. J. Tickle, in one of his letters, tells how
the Battalion thus early had experience of the guide who got
lost&mdash;a bitter experience which became all too common later on.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“After three days at Le Philosophe we wended our weary way
to the beginning of the small French communication trench, where
we picked up a guide from the battalion we were relieving. Did I say
‘Guide.’ By all the gods man ever swore by, but he was <i>no</i> guide.
Before reaching the support line there is only one turning&mdash;newly cut
by the British and perhaps the narrowest I have ever cursed about.
This guide managed to get us a mile down it before discovering his
mistake. We didn’t half laugh. It’s an hour’s hard pushing to
achieve such a distance through such a trench in full marching
order. Not satisfied with having lost his way, he endeavoured to
make up for lost time, and finished the course an easy first with the
rest of us breathless and knocked, straggling at wide intervals....”</p></blockquote>

<p>So the summer wore on, the war being so quiet that it was not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
uncommon for the Battalion to remain sixteen days in the front
line without relief. One tour was very much like another, and
the following by Irving is an excellent description of a typical
relief and march to billets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="author">“24th July, 1915.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Hurrah!! Hurray!!! I’m clean! clean! clean!
Also lice free! Oh, it is simply great!</p>

<p>“After a second stay of 16 days we left the firing line on the
night of the 22nd in the usual downpour. These affairs are rather
impressive in a way. Let us try to give you an idea.</p>

<p>“First of all, there’s the packing up and the cleaning of the
trench and dug-out for the new-comers. Then the long wait, each
man in his firing position, for the relief. Then the crushing past
the full laden crowds in the narrow trench.</p>

<p>“Then the long winding, never ending, communication trench
with its slippery floor, treacherous holes and deep muttered oaths
in the caressing whisper of the drizzle and the soft darkness. Till
you emerge into the quiet deserted streets of the cemetery-like
town, cross the main road, enter the twisted iron gates and pass up
the dark avenue of trees&mdash;a long, black line of dirty, merry warriors.
Now you’re within the shadow of the ruined church, fit place for
poets to weep. There it is outlined against the flying clouds, its
jagged grey tower, its dead clock always pointing at ten to two&mdash;and
the huge gaping black wounds in its sides. As you pass, the
edifice is lit up grotesquely and ghostlike by the pale light of a
distant trench flare, and you catch a fleeting glimpse of the ruined
interior where now the rude winds roar over the heaps of debris
and round the tottering pillars and broken altar making sport of
all these sacred things long held dear by so many&mdash;the whole an
eloquent and terrifying protest against the God-defying Hun!</p>

<p>“Then you go out into the wind-swept plain, following the line
of broken telegraph poles, dodging stray wires and shell holes&mdash;the
long, dark, single file&mdash;trudging, silent and sodden. Till at last
you reach the warm shadows of the village with its odd lights veiled,
and at the far end our farm billet with its clean straw and a dry
and dreamless slumber.</p>

<p>“That was the night before last.</p>

<p>“Yesterday was a good day’s work. I cleaned up everything
I had, equipment and kit, and with wild glee flung myself into
washing all my underclothes, socks and handkerchiefs, and drying
them, for it was a washing day to gladden Mother’s heart. And to
crown all, a starko behind the yellow stack&mdash;free, unfettered and
with an unlimited supply of water. One of God’s most wonderful
creations. How we worshipped it body and soul. Oh, the glory of
it! To be clean again is great! Great!!!! We sang and
danced and ran and jumped and shouted and flung our glad laughter
to the blue skies, and were thankful withal. Oh, Earth and Sky,
and Wind and Trees, and Green Grass and Strength of Man, Glory!”</p>

<p class="author">“<span class="smcap">W. J. Irving.</span>”</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

<p>During the whole of this time the French were making
a desperate struggle in the neighbourhood of Souchez and the
Lorette Heights&mdash;and occasional glimpses of this area were to be
had, though it was mostly enveloped in a thick cloud of smoke
from the bursting shells. The efforts of the French, however,
may have diverted the attention of the Boche, for he was
certainly very kind to the neighbourhood of Grenay and Maroc
during this pleasant summer weather. In fact, he seems to
have been more severe on the villages of Le Philosophe and
Mazingarbe (where the Battalion was sometimes billeted when
in reserve) than he was on the front line. At Le Philosophe on one
occasion a shell hit Battalion Headquarters, wounding a number
of Headquarters Company, including all the regimental police.</p>

<p>The event of the summer was the granting of leave to England
to a small party of the Battalion. The news was first received
on the 4th of July at Mazingarbe, and the C.O. (Colonel Renny),
the R.S.M. (Sergeant-Major A. Toomey) and Sergeant F. S.
Thurston were the first in the Regiment to enjoy the most
coveted privilege of the British soldier in France. Thereafter
the allotment of leave to the Battalion was at the rate of two
officers and four other ranks per week, though this rate was
not kept up for very long.</p>

<p>Colonel Renny, it should be mentioned, did not return from
leave, as he was detained in hospital in England. As
Commanding Officer, he was very popular with all ranks, and
for his age his energy was marvellous. The Battalion was very
sorry to lose its “little Indian Colonel,” as he was called. The
men felt they would miss him most in the front line, where it
was a very familiar sight to see him wandering round, indifferent
to danger or discomfort, but determined to see things for himself.
Colonel Renny was succeeded by Major H. V. Warrender, who
had hitherto commanded “B” Company. Major Warrender
was gazetted Lieutenant-Colonel in August, and remained in
command until the end of 1916. He thus holds the distinction
of having commanded the Battalion in war for a longer period
than any other commanding officer.</p>

<p>Trench life in the Grenay lines got very monotonous by July
and the popular grouse in the Battalion hereabouts referred to
the absence of the much-advertised Kitchener’s Army. A
notice chalked on a billet door in Quality Street read:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">“Lost, stolen or strayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Kitchener’s Army.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last seen in England in early spring.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>and the ditty often sung about this time which ended</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“If Kitchener’s Army don’t come out very soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twill be all up with this ’ere blasted platoon.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

<p>gives evidence of the general feeling of boredom which began to
threaten the Battalion.</p>

<div id="i72" class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">BREVET COL. A. M. RENNY, Ret. Ind. Army.</p>

</div>

<p>However, a portion at least of Kitchener’s Army appeared in
due course in this area, and during the last two days spent in
trenches to the right of the Double Crassier marked on the map
as W-2, the Battalion shepherded a kilted regiment on its trial
trip in the trenches. They were Scotch right enough (15th
Division), both in speech and character, and one of them, after
breakfast on the first day, asked in all seriousness what time
the “char-rge” was. He considered there ought to be at least
one every day. Another canny one, suspecting the “bona-fides”
of his tutor, when asked what port he had embarked
from, replied “Ah’ll no tell ’e.” Yet another youthful Jock
when told to go on sentry immediately climbed out in front
and began to march up and down at the slope.</p>

<p>Their commissariat went wrong and they got no food for
twenty-four hours. Their hosts saw to it that they had enough
to eat, and before dawn had picked sufficient mushrooms for
the combined messes, and by dinner enough young new potatoes,
carrots, red currants and gooseberries for a good meal.</p>

<p>After a few days in trenches at Le Philosophe, the 47th
Division moved into Corps Reserve, the Civil Service Rifles
occupying their old billets at La Beuvri&egrave;re early in August.</p>

<p>The Battalion now lost a very old friend in Lieutenant and
Quartermaster W. H. D. Clark, who was ordered to England to
take up an appointment in the Ministry of Munitions. Lieutenant
Clark had joined the Civil Service Rifles as a private in 1888, and
had served continuously since that time, rising through the
various ranks of N.C.O. to R.Q.M.S. until he was appointed
Quartermaster in 1910. Mr. Clark had been at all times a most
enthusiastic worker for the Regiment, and his energy knew no
bounds. He took away with him the most cordial good wishes
of all ranks. Another old friend in R.S.M. A. Toomey, a
Scots Guardsman who for many years had been on the permanent
staff of the Battalion, succeeded to the appointment of
Quartermaster, and C.S.M. Jolliffe of “C” Company acted as
R.S.M. Bernard Jolliffe was undoubtedly one of the most
popular members of the Regiment, and it was distinctly unfortunate
that ill-health compelled him to return to England a
few months after taking up his new duties.</p>

<p>The time at La Beuvri&egrave;re was spent in Sports (Brigade and
Divisional), Football and Cricket, Inspections and Training.</p>

<p>The Battalion distinguished itself by easily defeating both
the 6th London Field Ambulance and the Post Office Rifles at
cricket and the 4th London Field Ambulance at football. As
these teams had previously done well, it was considered a fine
performance on the part of the Civil Service Rifles to beat them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
all. G. Wright, H. E. R. Warton and J. H. Hunt of “D”
Company shone as batsmen, and Wright and Second Lieutenant
Stevens were the most successful bowlers. Lance-Corporal C.
Palser of “C” Company won the quarter mile at the Brigade
Sports, and Corporal Williams of the Transport Section was
second in the High Jump at the Divisional Sports, where Private
W. H. Domoney, an “A” Company bomber, won the open
competition for bomb throwing.</p>

<p>It was not all Sports and Pastimes at La Beuvri&egrave;re, however,
and soon the numerous parades and inspections began to pall
even as trench life had done. The now historic Brigade Order
ordaining that in future the brass tabs on the equipment and
the metal parts of entrenching tool handles were to be polished
caused one of the Regimental scribes to break into verse, and
his effort was a popular item at Company and Regimental
Concerts. It was described as the turn of the evening at a
Regimental Concert held some months later, and attended by
the offending Brigadier himself and the Commanding Officer.

<span class="medium">LOOS AND THE SPINNEY</span></h2>

<p>A return was made to the trenches at Maroc on the 1st September,
when it was found that the war had livened up considerably
during the three weeks’ absence at La Beuvri&egrave;re. The aerial
torpedo made its first appearance to the Battalion, and to judge
from the following letter home from a member of “B” Company,
caused some consternation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“When we first took these trenches over from the French there
was hardly a shell or a bullet all day. Now Hell is let loose. The
very first morning we were introduced to a novelty in the shape of a
gigantic bomb. The trench trembled and the air rushing into our
dug-outs almost blew us off our seats. We rushed out to see what
damage had been done, and could hardly believe our eyes when we
found that the bomb had exploded about 300 yards in front of the
trench. The next one burst not 40 yards away, and after the
blinding flash and the crash of the explosion I felt nothing. The
explosion is apparently upward rather than outward. It is thought
that the offending mortar works on a pair of rails and is whisked
back by the force of the recoil into the side of the slag heap. Smoke
rises when the bomb is fired, but a heavy shelling at this spot failed
to silence it. Now an Artillery Observation Officer watches the
spot all day, and immediately the smoke is observed his battery
fires and tries to catch the mortar before it gets back under cover.”</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Preparations for the big attack at Loos now overshadowed
everything else, and the Battalion was out every night on
working or carrying parties&mdash;such light jobs as carrying gas
cylinders, digging assembly trenches and bridging trenches.
All who took part in them are agreed that these gas cylinder
fatigues were the most strenuous they ever had to do. On the
first night there were two men to each cylinder. The cylinder
weighed 180 lbs., and the men in addition carried their rifles
and 100 rounds of ammunition in bandoliers. The numerous
turns in the trenches were almost impassable obstacles, and to
realise the difficulty of lifting the cylinders round the corners
one must have done the deed. Arrived at last at the front
line, the cylinder had to be lifted up high and a sort of juggling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
feat indulged in to get it into the correct position desired by
the critical Royal Engineer.</p>

<p>Fatigues generally in these days were much more difficult
than at any other time of the war. Light railways had not yet
been developed, and it was not realised at this time how great a
handicap it was for a man to have two bandoliers of ammunition
swinging round his neck while he worked.</p>

<p>Apart from the working parties, a happy time was spent at
the little village of Houchin, where there was much cricket and
feasting and very little drill, and it was here that the Battalion
first had the use of motor buses in France.</p>

<p>When the battle eventually took place on the 25th September,
the Civil Service Rifles, as at Festubert, held a watching brief,
being in Brigade Reserve to the 6th and 7th Battalions, and
it was thought that this was the origin of the title of “God’s
Own.”</p>

<p>To the Civil Service Rifles the battle of Loos was chiefly a
spectacle, since, with the exception of two platoons of “B”
Company, the whole Battalion looked on from the reserve
trenches. The fate of those two platoons, however, brought
home to their friends the realities of battle.</p>

<p>Soon after the attack started, No. 6 Platoon went forward
over the top as a bomb-carrying party. Starting out twenty-five
strong the party soon suffered heavy losses, and only three men of
the party survived unhurt. No. 8 Platoon went to the rescue,
and although their fate was much better, they, too, had their
losses.</p>

<p>The killed included the ever-popular Lance-Corporal Tommy
Dodge, a great personality both in the Civil Service Rifles and
in the Civil Service Rugby Football Club.</p>

<p>Of the survivors, mention must be made of Corporal F. H.
Chinn, who had been sent with five men to establish a bomb
store in the second German trench. As the five became casualties,
he made three journeys up the side of the Double Crassier alone,
carrying each time as many bombs as he could collect.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After Loos there was a short rest at Verquin and Nœux-les-Mines,
where, on the 8th October, the Battalion lost the valuable
services of Captain H. H. Kemble, who became second in command
of the 23rd Battalion. As officer in command of “D”
Company, Captain Kemble had won the admiration and respect
of all ranks who served with him, and who were genuinely sorry
to lose him.</p>

<p>The winter campaign of 1915-1916 now set in in earnest,
and from this time onwards there was a long struggle against
the rain, mud, and trenches that were continually falling in.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

<p>A fleeting visit was paid to the neighbourhood of Hulluch,
where the Battalion was in reserve during the struggle on the
13th October, and narrowly escaped the fate which befel a
Battalion of the Black Watch who went down in attempting
the impossible feat of cutting their way, under very heavy
machine-gun and artillery fire, through enemy wire of incredible
thickness.</p>

<p>On the 28th October, “A” and “C” Companies had the
honour of representing the Battalion at an inspection by His
Majesty the King in a field near the village of Haillicourt.</p>

<p>Soon after their return the weather went from bad to worse.
Everywhere men were huddled on the firestep with just a
ground-sheet rigged over a couple of rifles placed across the
trench&mdash;the “shelter” thus formed carefully collecting and
depositing the rain-water down the neck of the passer by!
On every ration fatigue to the “lone tree” you floundered up
to the knees in mud and water. Private Beatty, of “A”
Company, soothed his feelings one night on slipping head first
into a slimy shell-hole with the following impromptu:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Mis-ry unspeakable,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Horrible, shriekable,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Groundsheets unleakable,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I don’t think.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rain never ending,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On us descending,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Simply heartrending.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Gawd&mdash;&mdash;!”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>when he fell backwards into another shell-hole, and the rest is
unprintable.</p>

<p>The effect of the incessant rain and water-logged trenches
began to tell on the spirits of all ranks. The days of hot meals
in trenches had not then arrived. Sheepskin coats, leather
jerkins and woollen gloves had not, at any rate, been issued to
the Civil Service Rifles, while gum boots, though sometimes
heard of, were seldom, if ever, seen. On many occasions, too,
the only implements available for the work of baling out the
water and thin mud from the trench bottom were picks and
shovels!</p>

<p>It is characteristic of the spirit of the troops that there are so
many good stories told of this period of discomfort. Although
it was found that the working parties increased as the strength
of the Battalion decreased, it was also found that the rum
ration increased, and one man of “A” Company benefited so
much by the extra ration that when his next turn for sentry
duty came, he faced the wrong way on the fire step and called
the attention of his platoon sergeant to a wood, which he said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
he could swear was not in front of him during his previous turn
of sentry duty!</p>

<p>Another story is told of the same man, who was a Scotsman,
during another of his turns of sentry duty. His platoon commander
suspected him of being asleep, and brought his sergeant
along to confirm or allay his suspicions. The man was resting
his head on the parapet and apparently gazing straight to his
front. The platoon sergeant said he felt sure the man was
awake, but suggested to his officer that he might test him with
a franc. The officer thereupon slipped a franc note on to
the parapet in front of the sentry’s face. Without taking
his eyes off his “front,” the sentry promptly opened his mouth
and took the bait. “The franc is yours,” said Lieutenant
Bates, whose doubts as to the alertness of his sentry were now
dispersed.</p>

<p>By way of a diversion, the Battalion was inspected during
one of the short rests in support trenches, by a civic dignitary
from London, accompanied by his Press photographer. Of all
the discomforts of life in France few, if any, were more irksome
to the British soldier than being visited by a civilian, looking
clean, and fat, and comfortable, who would return home and have
it duly advertised in the Press that he had just been to the front
to see things for himself.</p>

<p>It will always be a mystery to the troops why so many civilians
were allowed to come on these “Cook’s tours” to France at
the nation’s expense, and if the visitors had only thought for a
moment what effect their “patronage” had on the weary
soldier, who generally had to give up a few hours of his well
earned rest for an extra parade, there would not perhaps have
been so many photographs in the Press of “Mr. &mdash;&mdash; wearing his
steel helmet and box respirator while visiting the troops in
France.” The troops would not have minded so much if only
the distinguished civilian had included a visit to the front line
in his “tour of the trenches”!</p>

<p>In addition to the physical strain due to the continuous
exposure to atrocious weather, Companies in turn occupying
the “Spinney” trenches towards the end of the period had
their nerves sorely tried by the eccentricities of enfilade fire.
Shells burst against the inside of the parapet, and there were
some parts of the line in this very narrow salient which
appeared to be exposed to fire from the rear as well as other
directions!</p>

<p>There were as many as thirty casualties a day&mdash;a high average
for a trench tour. At one place in front of a steep quarry&mdash;subsequently
evacuated during bombardments&mdash;men were
constantly employed in filling and placing sandbags on the
parapet as fast as they were knocked down.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

<p>The communication trenches were impassable and consequently
the wounded could not be taken down until night, when
a perilous journey had to be made over the open country, the
stretcher bearers picking their way between shell holes filled
with water. There were no roads leading up to the line, the
district seemed to be unusually difficult to explore, and parties
of men were continually going astray.</p>

<p>The wastage in personnel due to the appalling weather and
shelling had so mounted up, that when eventually relief came,
the Battalion marched, or rather dragged itself out only about
300 strong.</p>

<p>The following extract from the diary of a bomber gives a
characteristic description of the close of this extraordinarily
uncomfortable period of the winter campaign of 1915-16.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“We were thankful, I can tell you, to make tracks at last for the
reserve line, but it was raining hard and it damped our spirits to find
our new trench waterlogged. We bombers had not been in our
dug-out an hour before one earth wall collapsed and buried our
equipment and belongings. We were too tired to grumble, but
propping up the fallen corrugated iron roof to form a side, we slept
soundly beneath the ruins. In the morning, in spite of the rain
and liquid mud, we set to and made a dug-out with groundsheets
and one or two pieces of corrugated. Our new abode was the envy
of our comrades. It had even a covered in hall where we cleaned
our boots before being permitted to enter. Then we won a brazier,
collared some wet coke, charcoal and wood logs and kept up a good
fire. I took off my boots every time I came in from a fatigue and
dried my socks and puttees. We sat round the brazier at night,
and by the light of the glowing and smoking logs&mdash;for candles we
had none&mdash;told stories and sang songs and were some company.
But our nerves were still strung, and when whizbangs came over
our way we fell down on the floor in strategic positions. The mud
was still awful, and everywhere the trench and ramshackle shanties
were falling in.</p>

<p>“It happened, however, a fine frosty night on that 13th
November, when we were relieved by the 1st Cameron Highlanders&mdash;as
fine a regiment of Scotch troops as you could wish to see. The
Highland accent was particularly soothing. We marched as far as
Mazingarbe that night.</p>

<p>“Next morning was the day for Divisional Relief, and as the
Battalion marched out of the village, other troops were marching
in. It was a fine, dry, frosty morning, and official War Office cinema
operators took pictures all along the route&mdash;we with our trench
mud still on us, some wearing sleeping helmets in lieu of caps buried
in fallen trenches, a be-draggled and motley band, hardly able to
put one foot before another&mdash;and the incoming troops marching on
the other side of the road spotlessly clean and fit.</p>

<p>“As we neared the railhead at Noeux les Mines the Battalion
found its old self and tried to sing with as much vigour as trench
throats would allow:</p></blockquote>

</div>

<p>“It was fine to be in the train again, and to see cows once more
browsing at peace in the fields. We all fell in love with Lillers and
soon forgot our troubles.”</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Memories of what was afterwards known as “the 1st Lillers”
(for the Battalion visited Lillers again at the next Corps Reserve)
are of the pleasantest. The billets were good, there were plenty
of sports and amusements, and there was an appreciable increase
in the leave allotment to the Battalion.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="medium">WINTER IN THE LOOS SALIENT.</span></h2>

<p>The last month of 1915 found the Civil Service Rifles in trenches
in what was justifiably called a “hot corner.” After the holiday
at Lillers, the Battalion went to occupy the well-known Hairpin
trench, near Loos.</p>

<p>Some months previously the general run of the German
front trench had been along the crest of a ridge, the English
line being parallel and about 100 yards below. An attempt
to capture the crest had only partially succeeded, and about
fifty yards of the German trench was occupied by English troops.
A trench was dug from each end of this strip to the English
front line, thus forming the Hairpin. On each side of the
captured piece of trench a stretch of about 50 yards was left
unoccupied by either side, but obstructed by the usual block
guarded by bombers.</p>

<p>To connect up their front line again the Germans dug a trench
in front of the captured piece.</p>

<p>It will readily be understood that this was not a healthy
spot, and the advantage of holding the captured 50 yards of
German trench was a very doubtful one, as the occupants came
in for a very liberal bombardment.</p>

<p>But <i>the</i> tragedy of the Hairpin came on the night of the 20th
December, when the Battalion was ordered to send all its bombers,
together with some bayonet men from “B” Company, over
the top on the right of the Hairpin to jump into the German
trench and bomb along it, while a party from the 7th Battalion
restored a barricade (in the German front line adjoining the
afore-mentioned captured strip of 50 yards) which the Germans
had rushed early that morning.</p>

<p>The attack was most gallantly led by the Battalion Bombing
Officer, 2nd Lieutenant A. M. Thompson, an officer of the 14th
Royal Fusiliers, attached to Civil Service Rifles, but from the
outset there was not the slightest chance of success. However,
2nd Lieutenant Thompson and the N.C.O.’s and men with
him went to their end unflinchingly, and though the enemy
put down an impenetrable barrier of bombs, rifle grenades and
machine-gun bullets, the tragic scheme went on until all officers
and N.C.O.’s taking part had been put out of action.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<p>There were many most valuable lives lost on that night
unfortunately, as it turned out, to no purpose, for the Germans
a few days later blew up the whole trench and a number of the
23rd London Regiment, who were holding it, went with it.</p>

<p>Although Second Lieutenant Thompson had only been with
the Battalion a few months, he had speedily won the confidence
and respect of all ranks, for at all times he set a fine example
of courage and devotion to duty. He was buried the next
evening in the right leg of the Hairpin.</p>

<p>Of Lance-Corporal L. H. Druett, who died a true hero’s death
in that disastrous enterprise, it is difficult indeed to speak
sufficiently highly. His sterling qualities as a soldier, a companion,
and a real white man, won for him the respect and
admiration of the most careless.</p>

<p>Associated for a long time with Lance-Corporal Druett was
Private A. B. Evans, otherwise “Taff” Evans, known to the
bombers as “The Bird” (having a trick of putting his head to
one side like a magpie), another of the stalwarts who lost his
life in the struggle at the Hairpin while going to the assistance
of another bomber; and, among others, mention must be made
of Lance-Corporal M. Roach, who was in charge of a large party
of “B” Company bombers and bayonet men, and who was
fatally wounded whilst working on one of the barricades, after
doing splendid work that night, and of Private E. G. Crockett,
who, although severely wounded in the stomach, walked unaided
to the Dressing Station over 100 yards away, but it was impossible
to save his life, and he died in hospital nearly a fortnight
later. Both were great favourites in “B” Company, where
they had been well known for their good sportsmanship and
cheerfulness.</p>

<p>The bombers were naturally hit harder than other sections
in this sad business, and another who could ill be spared was
Private H. M. Nash, a modest and unassuming fellow, who had
only recently become a bomber. It is said that he threw his
bombs like a cricket ball some 45 yards, and, after his
officers and N.C.O.’s had been hit, he performed many deeds
of gallantry before he met his death.</p>

<p>Enough has been written to give an idea of the losses at the
Hairpin. They were all men whose places it was felt could
never be adequately filled, and consequently the Battalion
was not in a particularly joyous mood for Christmas, which
was spent in trenches and cellars near the Water Tower at
Vermelles. The conditions did not lend themselves to a merry
Christmas, for there was no chance at all of celebrating Christmas
Day, and it was not until Boxing Day that the Christmas letters
and parcels were received.</p>

<p>In consequence of an alarm, a sudden move had to be made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
on Christmas Eve to support positions at Vermelles, and the
whole of that day and Christmas Day were spent in “standing
to,” so there was little opportunity for merry-making. But on
Christmas night the alarm died down and a move was made to
huts at Noyelles, where some succeeded in dining not wisely
but too well on parcels from home, puddings from the <i>Daily
News</i>, and Army rum. The Battalion canteen managed at
this time by Ibbett, had now got into its stride, and its stock
included welcome barrels of stout, in addition to champagne,
port, sherry, whisky and a few other “dainties.”</p>

</div>

<p>New Year’s Eve was not even as cheerful as Christmas Eve,
for the Battalion was now in the front line at the Hohenzollern
Redoubt, and the artillery on both sides were busy playing the
old year out&mdash;the infantry in the front line getting the full
benefit of it.</p>

<p>But before the New Year was many hours old, the Battalion
had a real stroke of good luck&mdash;a German mine blew up prematurely
in front of them, thus saving them from what was easily
the most unpopular frightfulness of the war!</p>

<p>The New Year was also marked by an act of gallantry which
was afterwards recognised by the award of the Military Medal
to the two men concerned&mdash;Corporal P. J. Tickle and Drummer
H. Hogwood.</p>

<p>The Hohenzollern Redoubt was not a pleasant spot. There
had been a good deal of fighting in the neighbourhood during
the past three months, and khaki figures still lay stiff and grim
in No Man’s Land where they had fallen. There were therefore
no regrets when the Division was relieved by a Cavalry Division
about the middle of January, 1916, and the 47th Division
relieved the 18th French Division in the Loos sector.</p>

<p>The Civil Service Rifles brought to a close its long association
with this neighbourhood by a short spell of trench warfare in
the trenches on the eastern fringe of the village of Loos, and on
the famous Double Crassier. The situation on the Double
Crassier was unique in a way, for both English and German
trenches ran across these two big slag heaps. The troops invariably
returned from these trenches looking like so many
coal miners, for there was coal dust floating about everywhere.</p>

<p>The district lived up to its peace-time reputation as a centre
of mining activity, for the hated mine warfare was pursued
freely about this time with the usual accompaniment of minenwerfers.
Otherwise life hereabouts was more or less uneventful,
except for a big display of war-time fireworks on the Kaiser’s
birthday, January 27th. It was thought the great War Lord
would celebrate his birthday by making a big attack, but on the
front occupied by the 47th Division he was apparently satisfied
with a heavy bombardment.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

<p>There have been numerous poets in the ranks of the Civil
Service Rifles, and there are many creditable effusions which,
perhaps through the modesty of the poet, will never see the
light of print. Some, however, have been saved, including
some verses on the exploits of Private Beatty, a bomber of “A”
Company, an odd, scraggy little man, with a husky voice, known
to his intimates as Potgut Woodbine. He is immortalised by
Hanna in his</p>

<p>It was agreed by all that this gem should not be lost to the
world, and it was reproduced some months afterwards in the
<i>Hazeley Wail</i>, a magazine published by the 1st Battalion wounded
who had returned to the Reserve Battalion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hopes were now raised by rumours of another period in Corps
Reserve and a return to Lillers, but the Division was not destined
to leave without a little excitement, for in the early hours of the
15th of February, the last day at Loos was heralded by the
blowing of a big mine by the Germans under the front line
held by the 7th London Regiment on the immediate right of the
Civil Service Rifles. A diary of a bomber describes it thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“This morning I had just fallen asleep, after an arduous night
fatigue, followed by a cold stand-to, when the earth walls of the
dug-out shook with so violent a tremor that I thought we should
have been buried alive. I rushed outside to find the enemy firing
like mad! Rifle grenades, trench mortars, aerial torpedoes, and
death-dealing whiz bangs were falling in all directions. Some 50
yards to our right a new volcano now reared its ugly sides to Heaven.
The Teutons had got their own back. The mine was theirs. But
before the earth had finished falling, our Private Sugars (attached
140th Brigade Machine Gun Company) from the front line trench,
about 50 yards from the mine had turned his machine gun on to
the position, and his continuous stream of lead stopped the German
attempts to rush the crater. Indeed, a heap of slain told the losses
of their bold but fruitless attacks. Alas! a party of the Seventh
had met the fate we so dreaded ourselves! They had gone up with
the mine! Truly our luck was in.</p>

<p>“In half an hour all firing ceased as if by consent, and we settled
down to prepare breakfast. Bulldog Harris, the C.S.M. of ‘C’
Company, had been issuing rum at the time of the explosion. With
great presence of mind he had saved the precious liquid from the
falling debris with his cap. So we got our ration. Many of the new
draft needed such a pick-me-up, for we quite thought the strafe was
a prelude to a German attack. The enemy was said to have massed
his reserves on this front in readiness for an offensive.</p>

<p>“Thank God we are to be relieved to-night! To-morrow we
should be on terra firma again, far away from the terrors of mines
and counter-mines. There will be no need to watch the sky for
those fatal rockets or to fall flat on the trench path to escape the
full fury of the nasty tearing Minnie.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<p>“To good old Lillers with its ancient market place and quaint
medi&aelig;val images of the saints carved in niches over the principal
shops&mdash;a town now flowing with Bass, Worthington and cheap
champagne&mdash;snug Auberges, too, where you can dine in luxury for
1 franc, 75 cents. To Lillers!”</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The troops were naturally in the best of spirits on the morning
of the departure for Lillers. The transport had to go the whole
way by road, and started in a perfect blizzard at about 5.0 a.m.</p>

<p>The rest of the Battalion went by rail as usual from Nœux-les-Mines,
and, soon after arriving at Lillers, the welcome news
arrived that the Division had said good-bye to the Loos sector,
and on its return to the front line would try conclusions with
the Boche in a new area.</p>

<p>There were many informal “celebrations” of the completion
of the first year in France during a very pleasant fortnight
spent in Lillers, where, in spite of intense cold and much snow,
all ranks contrived to be merry and to forget the war, except
for the various alarms, notably the two days’ stand-to in billets
for Verdun.</p>

<p>A typical Company “celebration” held at the Restaurant
Picot on the 27th of February has been recorded:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Covers were laid for 40. Our spirits were high and our appetites
huge as we tucked into two helpings each of soup, sardines, tongue,
chicken and peas, fruit, blanc mange and dessert. At 6.0 p.m. we
could toast each other in French beer, cheap champagne and port.</p>

<p>“During some of the courses, Cooper, Lawman and others warbled
sweetly at the piano, and by the time the dessert course was reached,
the fun had become fast and furious. Old Picot himself, a fat and
jovial Frenchman of 50, danced and frolicked with the youngest.</p>

<p>“There were no speeches made or toasts drunk to those whose
faces we so sadly missed at the festive board, but was it altogether
fancy that made us feel their presence?”</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The occasions on which an infantry soldier in France was
able to have a bath were so few and far between in these early
days, that the event was usually recorded in the official Regimental
War Diary. In the mining districts advantage was generally
taken of the civilian baths at the mine heads, but sometimes
the Divisional baths were installed in breweries, electric light
works, or, in fact, anywhere near a water main. The baths
naturally could not be near the billets of all units in the Division,
so that a bath was often preceded and succeeded by a long
march in full marching order at a most inconvenient time of day.</p>

<p>These objections were ultimately overcome in the Civil Service
Rifles by Lieutenant-Colonel Segrave, who brought canvas baths
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
from London, won a Soyer stove or two from Ordnance, and
instituted the Civil Service Rifles baths, which were open daily
whenever the Battalion was out of the line.</p>

<p>The ceremonies at the Divisional baths generally took place
during a Battalion’s rest in Divisional or Corps Reserve, and a
scribe of “B” Company was so impressed with the baths at
Lillers as to write the following account in a letter home:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Platoons went in turns to the brewery for a bath. Imagine, if
it is not too shocking, twelve of us at a time bathing in a mash-tub,
and the unusual spectacle of 24 feet and I don’t know how many
toes meeting in the middle. No wonder somebody described
the atmosphere as ‘foetid.’ You kept on losing the soap and diving
for it under other fellows’ legs.”</p></blockquote>

<p>At Poperinghe, later on, the baths were run by a hustler
who could now get a lucrative appointment on the District
Railway. After three weeks of trench life, a man was allowed
exactly thirty seconds under the hot spray and was then allowed
to dry himself in a strong breeze while the minions of the Divisional
Laundry Officer disinfected his clothing, which in some
baths had to be strung up in a bundle on a hook to protect him
from pickpockets.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first year in France was rapidly drawing to a close, and
though many gaps had been caused in the ranks by casualties
and many by members of the Regiment being appointed to
commissions in other Regiments, the Battalion as a whole had
undergone little change. The work of the first year could be
looked upon with satisfaction, and although “God’s Own”
Civil Service Rifles had not taken part in any big assault, there
had been many little items of “dirty work” done.</p>

<p>The short stay at Lillers passed all too quickly and soon the
Battalion trekked out in the snow, the remainder of the time
in Corps Reserve being spent in training at the villages en route
to the new area.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="medium">NOTRE DAME DE LORETTE</span></h2>

<p>The new area proved to be the northern end of the famous
Vimy Ridge, which the Battalion approached by easy stages,
for although the Division took over the “Carency Sector”
of the line on the 13th of March, it was not until the 10th of
April that the Civil Service Rifles went into the front line. The
interval had been spent in reserve billets in the French huts
in Bouvigny Woods, in the partially deserted village of Villers
au Bois, the wholly deserted village of Carency, the fully inhabited
and rather pretty (for the Pas de Calais) village of Fresnicourt,
and in the support trenches on the hill known as Notre Dame
de Lorette (or Lorette Spur). These trenches had looked down
on the long struggle by the French in 1915 for Souchez, the
famous Zouave Valley, and for a footing on Vimy Ridge.</p>

<p>Lorette Spur was the most popular of all trench areas with
the men, for by day there was no movement allowed and they
were thus left undisturbed. It was here that the first anniversary
of landing in France was spent. What little shelling there was
went to Battalion Headquarters in the ruined village of Ablain
St. Nazaire, and by night the working parties were all in the
neighbourhood of the trenches occupied by the men themselves.</p>

<p>The Lewis Gunners were particularly happy on Lorette Spur,
for they had good dug-outs and little or no work to do. It
was in these trenches where Private Roessli (a Lewis Gunner)
distinguished himself as a sculptor, for he had ample opportunities
and much good material in the chalk with which the dug-outs
were lined.</p>

<p>Evidence of the popularity of Lorette Spur is found in Corporal
“Paddy” Guiton’s description:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Shortly after this we wended our weary way to the trenches
lying in the valley under one of the spurs of the Lorette heights.
There we relieved a battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment, ‘the
old tin pots.’ I asked one of the outgoing N.C.O.’s what the place
was like. He replied in his quaint northern dialect: ‘It’s like
convalescent whoam, lad.’</p>

<p>“We lived in the so-called dug-outs, or rather surface shanties
in this region, and ‘C’ Company, at any rate, had quite a ‘cushy’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
time. There were numerous fatigues, of course, but the Hun let us
alone, and we had great comfort&mdash;derived from the fact that we had
fires with real coal as fuel. There was quite a good fireplace in my
lair, which was inhabited by four other N.C.O.’s, and our picnics
here even on rations (without parcels) were singularly delightful.
These fires were only allowed during the hours of darkness as the
smoke might otherwise be perceived by enemy observers.</p>

<p>“We renewed our coal periodically by making nocturnal visits to
the old sugar refinery at Souchez, nothing of which now remains but
a mass of twisted iron girders and a heap of stones mixed with coal
slack. This ground is that so valiantly won back by the French
during our attack at Loos, and previously in May, 1915, was the
scene of the most bitter and desperate fighting. The ground in the
neighbourhood is scarred with the almost obliterated remains of old
trenches and we found an interesting pastime in reconstructing the
scenes and locating the various trenches held by our allies and the
enemy.</p>

<p>“Sometimes in the evening we held sports meetings, of which an
organised rat hunt formed the principal feature. On these occasions,
Sergeant Chick distinguished himself greatly. Even now I can see
his lean figure, leading the chase, a thick stick brandished in his right
hand.</p>

<p>“My enjoyment of the life at Notre Dame de Lorette was too full
to last, and one evening quite unexpectedly, ‘Bulldog’ Harris
warned me to prepare for leaving with the billeting party.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Loretto! I earnestly hope that all the troops who
are bearing the heat and burden of the day will find the same calm
and contentment that I did under the shadow of your frowning
cliffs.”</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The front line trenches on Vimy Ridge were considerably
cleaner than those at Loos, and although there was an extraordinary
amount of mine blowing, there were times in the
early spring of 1916 when life even in the front line was not
too bad.</p>

<p>Out at rest, excellent sport was to be had in the nightly rat
hunts in Bouvigny Woods, as well as cricket and football, and
the Officers’ Riding School under Lieut. W. H. Craig, the new
Transport Officer, who had originally come to France as Transport
Sergeant.</p>

<p>The situation in the front line astride the Souchez River
was somewhat uncommon, for there was no trench at all, the
line being held by means of three breastworks, each holding
about a platoon, about 100 yards apart. The remainder of the
Battalion occupied a quarry and an old trench behind.</p>

<p>It became quite a daily practice of the enemy at this time
to blow a mine at sunrise and sundown.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 29th of April, 1916, a mine was blown
under the front line held by the 6th Battalion, on the immediate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
right of the Civil Service, who were astride the Souchez River.
The 6th suffered heavy casualties and two sections of bombers
and two Lewis Gun teams were sent from the Civil Service to
assist them. Sergeant E. M. Knapp in charge of the bombers,
was conspicuous throughout for his fearless and untiring work
on the crater. He himself organised the bombing posts, not
only of his own men, but also those of the 6th Battalion.</p>

<p>In recognition of his splendid work on this occasion, Sergeant
Knapp was awarded the D.C.M. This gallant conduct was
typical of all the work done by Sergeant Knapp, who was a
real tower of strength to the Battalion bombers. As a leader
of men he was unrivalled, and his zeal and enthusiasm were a
constant inspiration to the men he loved so much and who in
turn loved him. As a parade N.C.O. Sergeant Knapp was once
described as a “Ragtime” soldier, but his enthusiasm and
sterling work in the face of danger endeared him to the hearts
of all men in the Battalion. All members of the 1st Civil Service
Rifles were justly proud of “Knappski”&mdash;a leader whom the
men would follow anywhere.</p>

<p>Other members of the Regiment who distinguished themselves
on the 29th of April immediately the mine was blown
were Corporal (afterwards Sergeant) E. M. Nottingham, attached
to the 140th Brigade Trench Mortar Battery, who gained the
D.C.M., and Corporal Smedling, also with the Trench Mortar
Battery, who gained the M.M.</p>

<p>From the time of his arrival in France in March, 1915, to
the time of his death at the battle of Messines in June, 1917,
Sergeant Nottingham had proved himself a man who scorned
danger and loved the life of the trenches. The exploit which
won him his D.C.M. was only one of many such in the life of
a most capable leader, who will never be forgotten by those
who served with him.</p>

<p>The month of May, 1916, opened with a pleasant picnic in
Bouvigny Woods, followed by a restful spell in the trenches on
Lorette Spur. Here there was an excellent view one night
of the explosion of six British mines in rapid succession on
Vimy Ridge, accompanied by an unparalleled display of fireworks
of all descriptions. As the men watched the display
from a comfortable distance at the top of Notre Dame de Lorette,
not one had the least suspicion that it was very soon to be the
cause of the most severe blow that fortune had so far dealt to
the Civil Service Rifles.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="medium">VIMY RIDGE, 1916</span></h2>

<p>On a gloriously sunny afternoon in May, a man was dozing
outside his hut in the pretty little woods at the village of Camblain
L’Abb&eacute;, where the Civil Service Rifles were billeted in Brigade
Reserve. The Brigade had just taken over the Berthonval
sector of trenches on Vimy Ridge, and the Civil Service Rifles
were to spend a week in what appeared to be the most delightful
village they had visited in Northern France.</p>

<p>It was one of those days when it feels good to be alive. The
birds sang sweetly in the trees, and the delightful natural fragrance
of spring was everywhere.</p>

<p>The afore-mentioned man, like many of his friends, had
partaken of a comfortable dinner, washed down with what
was known as Royal Shandy&mdash;a mixture of stout and sweet
champagne, and as he settled down to a comfortable afternoon
nap he reflected that, after all, war was not too bad. Some
of the more energetic of his friends had gone for a walk to the
neighbouring village of Aubigny, others were busy writing
letters, but he preferred to have a lazy afternoon of pleasant
reflection. There would be many more opportunities for
excursions to Aubigny, as the Battalion had a whole week before
it in these delightful surroundings. Perhaps in the evening he
would visit the local cinema, as he had not been to see “the
Pictures” for some time. However, that could wait too if he
did not feel energetic. How he wished the Division could stay
in this sector for the rest of the war! There had not been much
front line work lately&mdash;a Battalion only seemed to get one week
in four in the front line, and when there it was not too bad&mdash;a
few mines to make a little excitement, but then these were
very regular, as they always went up at sunrise and sunset in
this district, so you knew when to expect them. Yes, he thought,
as he dozed off to sleep, “It’s a bon war here.” He had just
fallen asleep when he was roughly shaken and told that the
Battalion was to “fall in” at once.</p>

<p>“I think they might have left us alone on a Sunday,” he
groused as he quickly got his equipment together. “Who is it
this time, I wonder? The Bishop of London or Horatio
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
Bottomley? And why have we to march to Villers au Bois to
see him? If he wants to preach to us why can’t he come here?
However, perhaps it’s one of these infernal training gags.
Major General wants to see how long it takes to move his reserves
about on a summer Sunday evening. Wonder if we shall get
back before the estaminets close?”</p>

<p>Similar thoughts were expressed by other members of the
Battalion, for the only order was “Battalion will parade at
once and march to Villers au Bois. Dress, full marching order.”</p>

<p>Although the order came round in the middle of tea, the
Battalion was on the road in an astonishingly short space of
time, and after a hot and dusty march a halt was called in a
field near the battered old church of Villers au Bois. Here
many of the men took the opportunity to strip to the waist and
rub themselves down with towels. Speculation was still rife
as to what it all meant, but the general opinion was that it was
a training stunt, which was regarded as the very worst taste on
the part of those in authority. Rumours of “dirty work afoot,”
however, began to spread through the ranks, and soon the order
came to occupy what was known as the Maistre Line&mdash;a line of
trenches that had been planned as a third line of defence in
this sector.</p>

<p>Once outside the village a wonderful sight met the eye. About
two or three miles away, hanging over the area of the front line
trenches on Vimy Ridge, was a dense cloud of bursting shells,
and to make the scene more weird, not a sound could be heard,
either of guns or of the explosion of the shells, although it was
a beautiful still evening. The bombardment, although confined
to an area of little more than a square mile, was by far the most
intense yet witnessed by the Civil Service Rifles.</p>

<p>The Battalion was no sooner in position in the Maistre Line&mdash;a
trench about two feet deep, than orders were received to move
forward by Companies.</p>

<p>“B” Company led off, followed by “C” Company, two
Lewis guns, two sections of bombers, Battalion H.Q. and “D”
Company, and the remaining Lewis guns brought up the rear.
“A” Company remained behind to bring up rations and water.</p>

<p>The advance was along a very shallow and narrow communication
trench, and the scene of slaughter was approached
through a barrage of tear gas. Owing to the movement of other
bodies of troops progress was very slow, with the result that
the Battalion endured some hours of tear gas, but the line
moved slowly but surely towards the Cabaret Rouge on the
Bethune-Arras Road, the site of a ruined estaminet where
the Brigade Headquarters was now situated, just on the western
side of the Zouave Valley.</p>

<p>In the words of the Regimental Diary:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The enemy was indulging in the most intense bombardment
we had witnessed. He must have employed guns of every possible
calibre. The air was just one solid mass of bursting shells.”</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<blockquote>

<p>“We had little or no information as to what was happening, and
as darkness had now gathered and we were in entirely strange
trenches, there did not seem much chance of finding out.”</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The leading Company (“B”), under Captain H. B. Farquhar,
reached Brigade Headquarters at Cabaret Rouge at 10.15 p.m.,
and was ordered to report to the Commanding Officer of the
Battalion holding the left of the 140th Brigade Front. After
being loaded up with bombs and an extra 100 rounds of ammunition
per man, they staggered forth through the barrage of
the Zouave Valley, where the bombardment raged with its
most intense fury, and arrived almost exhausted at the Battalion
Headquarters of the left sub-sector of what was known as the
Berthonval Sector shortly after 1.0 a.m., on May 22nd. The
awful barrage of the valley had been negotiated almost without
loss.</p>

<p>The Company Commander was told on arrival at Battalion
Headquarters that the line of resistance and support line had been
lost, and that his Company would deliver a counter attack at
2.0 a.m. It was then 1.30 a.m., and there was therefore no time
to make any reconnaissance, nor was it possible to get any
information at all as to the precise situation. Captain Farquhar
was told that on his right the 6th and 7th Battalions would
co-operate, on his left a company of the London Irish, and with
him would be a party of bombers and details of the Post Office
Rifles, but where any of these troops were to be found was not
vouchsafed to him. He was told that one of his flanks would
rest on Ersatz Trench, but as he had never heard of Ersatz
Trench, nor was anyone there to show him where it was, he
might just as well have been told to rest his flanks on the Unter
den Linden. He was unable to find out whether there were
any British troops between him and the Bosche, or how much
of the line he was supposed to capture.</p>

<p>However, with these scant particulars, and with the information
that the objective was about 600 yards up the side of
the Ridge, Captain Farquhar was ordered to start his counter
attack at 2.0 a.m.</p>

<p>He called his Platoon Sergeants and his only other officer
(Lieutenant B. Scott) together, and acquainted them with the
scheme, and arranged his men in two waves, 6 and 8 Platoons
under Lieutenant Scott in the first wave, and 5 and 7 Platoons
in the second wave.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

<p>Reports differ considerably as to what exactly happened
afterwards, for it must be remembered that the operations
were carried out in total darkness, save for the fitful glare of
the German rockets and Verey lights, and as it is difficult to
get a reliable description of any battle, even in daylight, it is
even more difficult to describe this scramble in the dark, in
country which was strange to the attacking forces, few, if any,
of whom knew where to look for friends or foes. But there is
no doubt that the attack was launched at 2.0 a.m., and that
“B” Company advanced in two waves up the slopes of Vimy
Ridge, with no artillery, machine guns or Lewis guns supporting
them, and that very soon they came under such a murderous
and intense fire from enemy artillery, trench mortars, machine
guns and rifles, that very few survived unwounded. As far as
can be gathered from survivors, it appears that after taking the
British front line at 9.0 p.m., the enemy at once put out a barbed
wire obstacle, and the survivors of “B” Company claim that
a number of their men actually reached the wire, where, of
course, they were helpless.</p>

<p>The vast majority of “B” Company having been killed or
wounded, the foremest of the unwounded survivors, finding they
were now in a hopeless position, appear to have decided to take
cover in shell holes and await developments. Here they remained
throughout the whole of the following day in scorching
sunshine, looking for the best way of escape, and at nightfall
they were able to make their way back.</p>

<p>So much, and no more, is known of the fate of “B” Company,
but “C” and “D” Companies, who had followed them through
the valley, were more fortunate, for the former, under Captain
G. A. Gaze, arriving at the Battalion Headquarters at 1.50 a.m.,
were ordered to support the 18th Battalion (London Irish) at
once. As he was unable to get in touch with the London Irish,
Captain Gaze, assisted by a Company of the Post Office Rifles,
formed a defensive flank in Granby Street, where “C” Company,
dog tired as they were, set to work at once to make a decent
position, and at the same time scoured the country around in
search of the wounded, many of whom were rescued. It was
in this work of rescue that C.S.M. R. H. Harris (Bulldog Harris)
excelled himself. He went far afield in his search for his bosom
friend, “Kaffir” Howett, who, as C.S.M. of “B” Company
had gone down in the van of the attacking party. Harris was
unable to find his friend who was so dear to him, but he succeeded
in bringing in several others of the wounded, and carried on his
work of rescue untiringly until daylight. It should be remembered
that the whole of this rescue work was done under incessant
machine gun and artillery fire.</p>

<p>Another who accomplished great deeds on this occasion was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
Sergeant T. P. Chick, of “C” Company. It was daybreak
when his attention was caught by a wounded man of the Post
Office Rifles, who was lying out in front of the trench. He at
once announced his intention of going out to assist him, if
possible, and although it was now fully light, he persisted in
going out once more, and safely reached the wounded man.</p>

<p>Sergeant Chick was crawling back, and was not more than ten
yards from the parapet, when he was shot just over the heart,
and died about ten minutes afterwards.</p>

<p>He died for another, and his end was typical of his life of
noble self-sacrifice in the interests of others.</p>

<p>It became a habit at one time among some troops in the
Division to estimate the amount of work done by a unit by the
number of casualties suffered, but although a heavy casualty
list certainly indicates a “bloody” time, it does not follow
that a unit which suffers few or no losses has done nothing.</p>

<p>Of the three Companies involved in the fighting at Vimy
(for “A” Company took no part in the operations beyond
carrying rations), “C” and “D” Companies appear to have
got off comparatively lightly so far as casualties are concerned,
though it was due to the efforts of these two Companies that a
new front line was established so soon.</p>

<p>Under Captain A. Roberts, “D” Company was the last to
cross the Zouave Valley, and on arriving at Battalion Headquarters
the Company was ordered to support “B” Company.
Captain Roberts had least time of all in which to find out anything
about the situation, but he led his men up the slope and
they eventually occupied the old Reserve Line of the Battalion
originally holding the sub-sector. This line they now converted
into the British front line, and “D” Company, with a
few remnants of the Post Office Rifles, held it from Granby
Street to Ersatz Trench&mdash;the intended flanks of “B” Company’s
counter attack.</p>

<p>Prominent among the “D” Company men who helped in the
rescue of the “B” Company wounded was Corporal R. J. B.
Beazley, described by his C.S.M. as one of the best little fellows
in the Regiment. He made at least half a dozen journeys “out
in front” always returning with a wounded man.</p>

<p>A feature of the operations so far had been the entire silence
of the British Artillery&mdash;it was afterwards said that the enemy
attack took place in the middle of an artillery relief. But no
sooner had “D” Company dug a decent front line trench than
the British Artillery began to knock it about, and Captain
Roberts had to complain of shorts several times during the day.</p>

<p>The situation became quiet soon after daybreak and “C”
and “D” Companies were able to carry on with their work in
peace for a few hours, but during the day the enemy from time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
to time put down an intense barrage, lasting generally for about
half an hour, when the whole valley was filled with smoke,
debris and sheets of flame. Happily, there were few further
casualties on this account, and although the dose was repeated
late at night when the Battalion was relieved by the 24th
London Regiment, there was little further loss and the Zouave
Valley was left as it had been found&mdash;in a mass of smoke and
bursting shells.</p>

<p>The battle of Vimy Ridge, although not much more than a
minor operation&mdash;it is believed to have been the sequel to the
blowing of the six British mines in the vicinity on the night of
the 15th of May&mdash;has been described at some length because it
was the most important event so far in the life of the Civil
Service Rifles in France. Hitherto the Battalion had succeeded
in preserving more or less its original identity, but here, in the
short space of twenty-four hours, practically all that was left
of the original “B” Company had been swept away. It is
perhaps because of the sudden nature of the operation that the
losses came as such a shock to the surviving members of the
Battalion.</p>

<p>Captain H. B. Farquhar had long been the idol of “B”
Company, and a great favourite in other Companies in the
Battalion. He had done what he could to save his men from the
awful disaster, but as a soldier he had to obey orders, and, having
called his platoon sergeants together and told them all he knew
he bravely bade them good-bye, and, like the rest of his Company,
went to his doom without flinching.</p>

<p>Captain Farquhar has often been described as the finest
Company Commander the Battalion ever possessed.</p>

<p>He was keen, energetic and unselfish, a real pattern to his
officers, N.C.O.’s and men. A survivor of the “B” Company
of Captain Farquhar’s day has written an admirable character
sketch of “the skipper” and his henchman, Lieutenant Bobby
Scott, who perished with the first wave at Vimy.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Captain Farquhar.</span>&mdash;The skipper was a strong man. For all
his wit, sometimes sardonic, but always merry, he could be a man of
beaten steel on occasion.</p>

<p>“‘Old’ ‘B’ Company knew him well at Watford, but ‘old’
‘C’ Company really made his acquaintance in France.</p>

<p>“In the line he ignored danger in a matter-of-fact way that
inspired us as much as the theatrical bravado of a shallower man
would have unsettled us. In those never-ending front line spells
just before the ‘first Lillers’ he heartened us through many a weary
night as no other man I know could have done. To me, as a hardened
and persistent night sentry, he seemed to be an almost permanent
feature of the landscape of ‘No man’s land,’ strolling serenely up
and down as if taking a leisurely constitutional. He was always
on the spot when anything happened, and I think we got his habit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
of never shirking any objectionable job which could possibly be
considered ‘up to us’ to do.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Lieutenant Scott.</span>&mdash;‘An officer and a gentleman’ is probably
the most overworked if not the most misapplied phrase in the
military dictionary. It is too often thoughtlessly bestowed on any
nice-mannered, band-box officer. But it fitted Mr. Scott. He was
a real soldier and he was an instinctive gentleman.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Captain Farquhar had been ably supported by his C.S.M.,
F. Howett, known for many years throughout the Battalion as
Kaffir Howett.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Kaffir had made a name for himself long before the war
broke out, for he was for a long time associated with “Bulldog”
Harris as the life and soul of the Regimental School of Arms.
These two inseparables were also prominent members of the
Civil Service Rugby Football Club.</p>

<p>As a soldier, Kaffir Howett had many of the sterling qualities
of his Company Commander. He was a stern disciplinarian
and was fearless in the line, but while, he too, had a subtle
sense of humour, he was more of the “strong silent man” than
of the “merry and bright.”</p>

<p>The only consoling reflection about the loss of these more
than gallant fellows is that they could not have died in better
company, but what magnificent deeds would have been done
later in the year by such fellows as Farquhar, Scott, Howett
and Chick, and to them must be added Sergeant A. J. Andrews
(Long Andrews or Driver Andrews to his intimates) another old
pillar of “B” Company, who before the war had made a name
on the football field, and Corporal S. Crocombe, a staunch N.C.O.
of “B” Company, who, although rescued on the night of the
battle, succumbed to his wounds five days later.</p>

<p>Besides the killed, a number of the stalwarts of the Battalion
were wounded. In “B” Company alone, these included
Sergeants A. W. Hodgson, who had already been wounded once,
and F. Tyler (known as Wat Tyler), and Corporals H. W.
Rowland and F. Plaster, four N. C. O.’s who had been prominent
members of the Company for many years, whilst “D” Company
had to deplore the loss of Sergeant G. Wright, who in addition
to his fine military record, performed great deeds on the cricket
field.</p>

<p>The Lewis Gunners also had their losses, the outstanding one
being Lance-Corporal “Cocky” Oliver (wounded) whose ready
wit on all occasions was such a valuable asset to the Lewis Gun
Section.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="medium">CALONNE RICOUART AND SOUCHEZ</span></h2>

<p>It will be gathered from the foregoing that, in whatever light
the operation on Vimy Ridge was regarded by the General Staff,
to the Civil Service Rifles it was a battle of some importance,
and the loss of so many of the leading members naturally
plunged the survivors into something approaching deep
depression as they trudged wearily back to Camblain l’Abb&eacute; on
the morning of the 23rd of May. The Transport limbers were
met at Villers au Bois, and many weary men were thankful to
shed their equipment here, and some of the more exhausted
managed even to secure a lift for the rest of the journey.</p>

<p>The Transport Section, too, had played its part in the battle,
for every available horse and man had been employed during
the 22nd of May carrying bombs and ammunition across the
track to Cabaret Rouge in daylight. Fortunately they had
escaped any loss, either of men or horses.</p>

<p>Camblain l’Abb&eacute; was now very different from the quiet little
village that had seemed so far removed from the war two days
before. The whole Brigade occupied the billets recently
allotted to the Civil Service Rifles, and it was here that the news
of the counter attack by the 142nd Infantry Brigade was awaited
with such keen interest on the night of the 24th. The attempt,
however, like that of another Division a few days later, was
unsuccessful, and the crest of Vimy Ridge remained in German
possession until the Canadian victory of the 1st of April, 1917.</p>

<p>“The feelings of men leaving the danger zone for a period of
rest defy accurate portrayal. Each one has his own individual
thoughts, but they may be summed up in one word ‘contentment.’”
Thus writes a well-known N.C.O. of “C” Company,
who went so far as to say that the tension had been so great
for a short period that, on knowing himself to be out of immediate
danger for the time being, he felt as if he could have marched
fifty miles, with full pack and blankets thrown in!</p>

<p>“Every force has a recoil,” he continues, “and most men
feel tremendously bucked on leaving the trenches for a spell
out of the line.</p>

<p>“It was thus with feeling of great relief that the Battalion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
marched to Calonne Ricouart on the 25th of May, there to
forget their sorrows in the work of training and reorganisation.”</p>

<p>It is pleasing to be able to record the recognition, in the shape
of honours and awards, of some of the many acts of gallantry
performed in the Battalion on Vimy Ridge, and while at Calonne
Ricouart it was heard that the work of C.S.M. R. H. Harris
and Second Lieutenant F. Osborne was recognised by the
award of the Military Cross; and Lance-Corporal Mark W.
Hall, the leading stretcher-bearer of “B” Company, Sergeant
W. R. McKinley of “A” Company, Private S. H. Bressey
of “D” Company and Private L. Flanagan of “B” Company
were awarded the Military Medal.</p>

<p>Sports Meetings of various descriptions were held at Calonne
Ricouart, and as the billets were good and the weather generally
was fine, the troops soon began to recover their good spirits.</p>

<p>The Transport field was approached by a one-sided rustic
bridge over a stream. On one occasion almost the entire section
endeavoured to make “Onions,” the mascot, mule take a bath
from this bridge. The old lady, however, was proof against
all efforts, and the only thing that happened was that the side
of the bridge gave way. Lower down the road was a picturesque
water mill, and next to this an estaminet, “Au Joli P&ecirc;cher,”
provided liquid refreshment. Here Mlle. Felicit&eacute; always had a
roomful of thirsty <i>soldats</i> who required a great deal of la bi&egrave;re
to wash the dust out of their throats.</p>

<p>Large drafts of officers and men began to arrive from England,
and very soon the Battalion became once more up to strength,
and to complete the refitting, short rifles were now issued to
all N. C. O.’s and men in place of the long Lee Metfords with
which they had hitherto been armed.</p>

<p>The event of the “rest” was an original revue entitled “Spit
and Polish,” performed on the afternoon of the 10th of June at
the Cinema, Divion. The “leading lady” has given the
following account of the affair.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The first rehearsal took place in Lieutenant Sharratt’s billet.
After a lot of smoking and talking, but very little rehearsing, the
parts were allotted as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>The Bogus Brigadier</td>
    <td>Private Teasdale.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Adjutant</td>
    <td>Private Graham.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sergeant-Major</td>
    <td>Private Lloyd.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Colonel Straws, I.D.</td>
    <td>Private Chisholm.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Real Brigadier</td>
    <td>Second-Lieutenant W. H. Brantom.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Hon. Lady Lizzie</td>
    <td>Private C. Cooper.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>“The plot was written round the Hon. Lady Lizzie, who, bent on
war work, obtained a situation as typist in the orderly-room where
two Tommies&mdash;one disguised as a Brigadier and the other as an
Adjutant&mdash;had decided to run the war in their own way. Eventually
the real Brigadier comes on the scene. Lady Lizzie turns out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
to be his daughter and marries the bogus Brigadier, Sir Charles
Chaplin!</p>

<p>“The revue was performed four days after the first rehearsal.
Fortunately little memorising was needed as we relied chiefly on
gags. On the morning of the performance Captain Ind came over
to Divion to censor the dress rehearsal. Needless to say he cut out
some of the best things, though, even then, the show had some
‘kick’ left in it. And perhaps the revue <i>was</i> a trifle crude in places.
But there was no holding a man like Teasdale. With his quick wit
and fertile brain it required some nimbleness of mind to keep pace
with him in <i>everything</i>&mdash;especially as I was playing the girl’s
part!</p>

<p>“I don’t think anybody who was there will forget the occasion.
The battalion had marched from Calonne, a distance of three miles,
and arrived at the Cinema three-quarters of an hour before time, thus
giving the boys an opportunity for a concert to themselves.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> The
noise was terrific, the bombers singing their particular songs and
being howled down by the Lewis Gunners with their own pet ditties,
and vice versa. When ‘Posh Harry’ arrived he was greeted with
the refrain:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">13</a>
The pioneers (of whom the lengthy Foote and Ginger Facon
were notorious members) in the meantime prepared the stage,
proving themselves expert stage carpenters.</p></div>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I wish I were an R. S. M.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earning lots of dollars.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Etc., etc., etc.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“The first half of the programme consisted of single turns
frantically applauded. Then came the revue.</p>

<p>“I won’t attempt to describe it fully, but who will quite forget
the beauty chorus of those thirty nice, smart soldiers, headed by
Knapp, singing in harmony to the tune of ‘Boiled Beef and Carrots,’
that opening chorus:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Spit and Polish! Spit and Polish!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our fathers said in days of yore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Spit and Polish would win this war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Don’t walk about like dirty dogs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or lads from Eton College,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The only way to win this war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is&mdash;Spit and Polish!”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“Of this chorus, Sidwell, he of the staring eyes, was great as the
man who fainted on actually seeing the kidneys and best parts of
the meat handed to his Company when drawing rations at the Q.M.
Stores!</p>

<p>“The great moment, however, was Teasdale’s entry as the
Brigadier (on a chair with the back for the horse’s head) with umpteen
ribbons on his chest, wonderful top boots&mdash;his whole appearance a
thing of joy! He kept the house in a boisterous thunder of hilarious
applause right through to his final inspection of the beauty chorus
when he presented a tin of Brasso to poor old Knapsky!”</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span></p>

<p>The revue was a happy conclusion to a very enjoyable stay
at Calonne Ricouart, and shortly afterwards a return was made
to the front line trenches known as the Souchez Sector, a little
north of the village of Souchez.</p>

<p>The outstanding features of life in this area were the heavy
trench mortars used by the Bosches in the line, and the very
happy days in Noulette Woods, near the village of Aix Noulette,
when out of the line.</p>

<p>Early in July the Battalion was ordered to raid the enemy
trenches in the Bois en Hache, just north of Souchez, but
although five officers and 100 other ranks were specially trained
for the event, it was a dismal failure, and it has long been a
forbidden topic of conversation in Civil Service Rifles circles.
Fortunately the casualties were few, and the Battalion left the
area shortly afterwards to return to the dreaded Berthonval
sector on Vimy Ridge.</p>

<p>On this occasion, however, a very peaceful time was spent in
the front line, and it was hard to believe that it was the scene of
the big fight of two months ago.</p>

<p>The thoughts of every one were now turned to the big offensive
in the Somme district, and for some time the distant rumble of
guns, heard daily from morning till night, had given rise to
discussions as to when the 47th Division would move south to
join in the fray.</p>

<p>It was therefore no surprise when the Civil Service Rifles
marched out of Camblain l’Abb&eacute; on the 26th of July, 1916,
after four very happy days in that pleasant village, to start the
great trek to the Somme district.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="medium">THE TREK</span></h2>

<p>During its career in France, the Civil Service Rifles have frequently
moved over long distances by route march&mdash;a practice
known as “trekking”&mdash;but the great march of 1916 seems so
to have dwarfed all other performances of a similar nature, that
it is always referred to simply as “the trek,” and it is agreed
by all who took part in it, that the trek was one of the most
enjoyable experiences the Civil Service Rifles had during the
war.</p>

<p>At the same time the period was one of the most strenuous,
the daily programme of work being sometimes so crowded that
it hardly seemed worth while to go to bed. The Divisional
Commander was evidently a firm believer in early rising, for
r&eacute;veill&eacute; was often sounded at the early hour of 3.30 a.m.</p>

<p>The route from the mining district to the valley of the Somme
was distinctly roundabout, and for the first two or three weeks
of the trek the Division got farther and farther away from its
destination, until eventually it came to rest near the coast in
the Abb&eacute;ville district.</p>

<p>A pleasant march on the first day brought the Civil Service
Rifles to the village of Houdain, where Lieutenant G. G. Bates
organised a very successful Mess Dinner for officers at the Caf&eacute;
du Centre, and on the following day, after a short march, the
village of Valhuon, near St. Pol, was reached, where four enjoyable
days were spent in lovely summer weather. The weather,
indeed, was a little too summer-like on the day of the march
from Valhuon to Croisette. Not only was it so far the hottest
day of the year, but the march took place during the hottest
time of the day, and when Croisette was reached at 3.30 p.m.
many had fallen by the wayside. Other units of the Division
had similar experiences, and hereafter early rising was the
order of the day, r&eacute;veill&eacute; generally being sounded about an
hour before dawn so that training could be finished before the
heat of the day.</p>

<p>A common occurrence during the marches on the trek was
the failure to observe the infantryman’s most valuable
charter&mdash;ten minutes’ halt in every hour. The marches were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
usually by Brigades, and the starting point was often a mile
or so away from the billeting area. For some strange reason
the march to the starting point was wont to be hurried, and
what should have been the first halt was omitted altogether.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the march, again, the leading Battalion,
on approaching the village in which it was to be billeted, would
often cut out the halt as the appointed time was reached, and
go straight on to the billets. The succeeding Battalions on
such occasions would follow like sheep, irrespective of whether
they were billeted in the same village or in another one two or
three miles farther on.</p>

<p>In these circumstances it is not surprising that marches
which on paper looked nothing out of the ordinary were found
to be very arduous and trying, and men were frequently guilty
of the “crime” of falling out on the march.</p>

<p>At first early rising was voted a success by all ranks, but
when an afternoon parade was introduced and later an evening
parade just to fill up the day, the troops began to feel that
though it was “nice to get up in the morning,” it was certainly
“nicer to stay in bed.”</p>

<p>A day’s rest at Croisette was followed by a march to Fortel,
where, during a four days’ stay, a delightful bathing place was
discovered in the swift-flowing, icy cold waters of the River
Canche. “A” and “D” Companies and the Lewis gunners
have happy recollections of this stream, for the most part of
the two hours’ route march by Companies which formed part
of the daily programme was spent in and around the bathing
place.</p>

<p>The 4th of August at Conteville was marred by the sudden
introduction of an evening parade. The move from Fortel
had taken place in the early hours of the morning, and after
a very short march Conteville was reached at about 10.0 a.m.
The troops were still congratulating themselves on their luck
when the order came round that all units in the Division would
at once start to practise an attack on a wood or village.</p>

<p>The wandering life was resumed on the 5th of August, when
the Division moved to the training area near Abb&eacute;ville, the
Civil Service Rifles being billeted in the little village of Drucat.
The Division now settled down to serious work, and for three
weeks the troops trained strenuously every day. It is interesting
to note that the Division trained for its share in the battle of
the Somme near the historic battlefield of Cr&eacute;cy.</p>

<p>But although there was much hard work and the billets at
Drucat were poor&mdash;so poor that in many cases both officers
and men slept in gardens or fields&mdash;and the inhabitants inclined
to be hostile, memories of August 1916 are among the happiest
of the war.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

<p>A great drawback, however, was the scarcity of beer. The
estaminets in the village had none at all, nor did they attempt
to get any, for they were thus able to get rid of their stock of
atrocious wines. The Regimental Canteen eventually came
to the rescue by securing a supply of beer from Abb&eacute;ville.</p>

<p>The weather at first was all that could be desired, and bathing
was indulged in daily. At the end of the fields occupied by
the Lewis gun section and the Transport lines ran a narrow,
shallow stream. The men of the Transport section, by damming
the stream with a wall of filled sandbags, managed to construct
a pool just big enough for a man to plunge in, and the
bathing pool was thoroughly appreciated by officers and men
alike.</p>

<p>A number of N.C.O.’s and men were allowed to go to Abb&eacute;ville
each day, and a merry day in the old French town usually ended
with the hiring of antiquated “voitures” for the journey home.
The said “voitures” were invariably driven by members of
the Civil Service Rifles, the lawful owners or drivers always
being willing to hand over the reins, and many were the chariot
races run on the road from Abb&eacute;ville to Drucat by rival parties
from the Civil Service Rifles, the winning post being the Company
parade ground, where the races ended just as the Company
was on parade for roll call.</p>

<p>Cricket was played in the Lewis gun field, where, also, an
al fresco concert was given one day by a concert party sent by
Miss Lena Ashwell. The weather was most unkind that day,
but the spirits of the concert party, like those of the troops,
were not to be squashed by the rain, and the artistes, five charming
English ladies and two gentlemen, gallantly stuck it until
the deluge became so terrific that the noise of it drowned the
efforts of the whole party to sing “Chalk Farm to Camberwell
Green.”</p>

<p>What testimony to the attractiveness of the party could be
more eloquent than the simple fact that none of the audience
left the field! The appreciation of the audience was not limited
to the performance. It was a rare and refreshing feast to see
those five pretty English girls, especially to those, and they
were many, who had not been privileged to see an English girl
for more than a year. Moreover, the Civil Service Rifles were
told that they were the first real fighting troops to be entertained
by these ladies, who had hitherto had to content themselves
with entertaining those whose duties kept them at the Base.</p>

<p>Colonel Warrender thanked the artistes in his most delightful
style and expressed the sentiments of all ranks when he said
that it was the most enjoyable concert that had ever been given
to the Battalion.</p>

<p>While at Drucat the Battalion received a consignment of what
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
at first were thought to be toy bread-carts, such as are used in
London suburbs. But on inquiry it was found that these were
the new “Hand Carts, Lewis Gun,” intended to replace the
limbers.</p>

<p>These little carts were first “tried out” on the departure
from Drucat on the 20th of August with disastrous results.
The shafts broke before the first halt, and ere long each team of
Lewis gunners was stripped to the waist, their clothes and
equipment piled high on to the carts while they tugged and
pushed at their vehicles, gallantly struggling to keep up with
the Battalion. But in spite of these determined efforts they
were all very badly “tailed off.”</p>

<p>The route march concluded with an outpost scheme, and
in the evening the Civil Service Rifles were billeted in Villers
Sous Ailly, a pretty little village, conspicuous for the excellent
spirit of hospitality shown by the inhabitants&mdash;a welcome
change from recent experiences. The only regret about Villers
was that the Battalion had to leave the next morning.</p>

<p>The farce of the Lewis gun handcarts was continued, and
in spite of a great display of inventive genius by the Lewis
gunners, they were quite unable to keep up with the Battalion.
Perhaps the best suggestion was that of the man who said the
Lewis gunners should take turns at carrying the carts on their
backs!</p>

<p>It was said the carts had passed a severe test in the courtyard
of the War Office and had been found to run smoothly when
empty.</p>

<p>Leaving Villers Sous Ailly, two uncomfortable nights were
spent at Naours and Mirvaux (considered by many to be the
most dilapidated village in Europe outside the “forward area,”
and where one man pushed a whole wall down by simply leaning
against it!), and on the 23rd of August the 140th Infantry Brigade
reached Franvillers, near the Amiens-Albert road. Here there
appeared to be a concentration of all the flies on the Western
front, and it was thought that these were to take part in a new
form of attack!</p>

<p>Franvillers and district was used as a kind of “finishing
school” for troops in training for any particular phase of the
battle of the Somme in 1916, and as it was fairly near to the
battlefield, it had become an unusually busy centre. Troops
from all parts of the United Kingdom seemed to have passed
through and every available inch of space was used for billets.
The billets, owing chiefly to overcrowding, were very uncomfortable
and very dirty, and the natives were beginning to get tired
of the troops.</p>

<p>The training was of the very strenuous type&mdash;drills before
breakfast, attack practice after breakfast, musketry and digging
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
in the afternoon, and route march in the evening. It was now
known that the attack which was being practised daily over a
taped course was to be on a certain wood, but the name of the
wood was so far kept secret.</p>

<p>But in spite of this crowded programme, there were some
who found time for trips to Amiens, and there were many who
enjoyed the excellent bathing in a natural pool in the Ancre
at Heilly, a village south of the Amiens-Albert road.</p>

<p>It was at Franvillers that Sergeant R. F. M. Bigby earned
the gratitude of his comrades by securing an issue of rum for
all. According to his story he was drinking beer in an estaminet,
when the Regimental Medical Officer came in on a tour of inspection,
accompanied by the A.D.M.S. A mild outbreak of
enteric in the Division was causing the medical fraternity some
anxiety at the time, and efforts were being made to discover
the cause of it. The A.D.M.S. asked Sergeant Bigby what he
was drinking, but, on being informed, instead of ordering any,
as Bigby had expected, the doctor inquired about the quality
of it. The gallant sergeant assured the medicos that the quality
was poor, but that if followed by a ration of rum there were no
ill effects. On the contrary, a ration of rum at night, especially
during bad weather and in bad billets, had been found to be a
pretty sure prevention against enteric, which complaint, added
Bigby&mdash;as the medicos were doubtless aware&mdash;was getting
rather troublesome at Franvillers. But then, there had not
been an issue of rum so far in that village, so could one be
surprised?</p>

<p>When, very shortly after this interview, a ration of rum was
issued to the troops, there were few in the Division who did
not acclaim the name of Bigby!</p>

<p>Early in September it became known that the 47th Division
was to attack the German positions in and around High Wood&mdash;positions
which had already been captured by more than one
Division, but afterwards retaken by the Germans, who, throughout
six weeks of heavy fighting, had resisted all attempts to
dislodge them permanently. To the Civil Service Rifles were
allotted the first German lines in the wood itself, with the 7th
Battalion on their right and the 17th Battalion on their left.
Henceforth there was a state of suppressed excitement in the
Battalion, and all ranks took the very keenest interest in the
full dress rehearsals over a marked-out battlefield, which occupied
the last days of training at Franvillers. These “shows” were
attended by the whole Division, including Artillery, Trench
Mortars, and the contact aeroplanes attached to the Division,
and the attack was practised with zero at every possible hour
of the day or night.</p>

<p>By the time Franvillers was left, on the 12th of September,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
every man understood what he had to do and where he had to go
in the battle.</p>

<p>A few privileged persons had been to see a demonstration of
the great secret of the war&mdash;the Caterpillars, as they were called
in those days, also frequently referred to at this time as the
“Hush! Hush!” These new engines of warfare, which soon
became known as Tanks, were to make their first bow to the
public by assisting in the attack on High Wood, where two of
them were eventually allotted to the Civil Service Rifles in
place of an artillery barrage.</p>

<p>After leaving Franvillers, the Battalion took the fine Route
Nationale to Albert, “a city of empty and ruined houses, some
occupied by our troops, others barred and bolted as if a very
plague had taken off the population.” The Civil Service Rifles
passed right under the shadow of the ruined cathedral with the
gilded Madonna and Child hanging face downwards from the
top of the steeple. From Albert the Battalion marched to
Becourt Wood and relieved the 2nd Royal Sussex in what
looked like a big rubbish tip, remaining there in reserve until
the 14th.</p>

<p>The scene which met the eye after passing through Albert
has been recorded by Corporal De Ath, who was attached to
the 140th Trench Mortar Battery.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I shall never forget the sight that met our eyes on the other
side of the town,” writes De Ath. “It took us some time to realise
that we were looking on what was to us, an almost incredible and
unheard of thing&mdash;a vast armed camp just behind the trenches and
well within shell fire. As far as the eye could see there were miles
of tents, bivouacs, limbers and horse lines. Huge dumps of supplies
and ammunition covered the ground, and between them, in any old
corner, were the big guns&mdash;huge monsters roaring incessantly and
devouring the great piles of shells stacked around. Everywhere
were scenes of the greatest activity, and one could only rub one’s
eyes and gasp at this astounding spectacle. The colossal cheek of
that great camp rather shocked us, but there it was, unconcerned
and undisturbed, thanks to our magnificent aircraft, constantly
patrolling above with never an enemy plane daring to do likewise.</p>

<p>“We pitched our bivouacs on the crest of a ridge just behind the
old front line, and to the left of Becourt Wood. From that high
point we got a good view of the surrounding country. At our feet
the usual flotsam and jetsam of abandoned trenches with their
tangled heaps of barbed wire. Away behind us was the wooded
country-side which came as a change after the drab monotonous
scenery of the Flemish Flats. Closer at hand the ruined Cathedral
caught one’s eye.</p>

<p>“But away in front, in the wake of the advance, the picture was
entirely different. It was a scene of desolation&mdash;a desert of low
ridges, scarred and marked by blurred lines of chalk trenches and
shell holes. Here and there a few jagged tree stumps stood out, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
nearly every feature of the landscape had been swept away by the
furious pounding of our shells.</p>

<p>“All along the sky line our heavy shells and shrapnel were bursting
continually, so that the smoke never ceased. Now and again it
would slacken only to break out again with double intensity. Behind
and around us the ‘Heavies’ boomed and roared, whilst in front in
every little valley and hollow, even in the open without pretence
of cover, our 18-pounders snapped and barked viciously, alternating
with the deeper notes of the 4&middot;5’s and the 60-pounders. Between
whiles one heard the heavy ‘crump’ of the Hun shells.</p>

<p>“A confused blur showed where a village once stood, but only
a heap of rubble and dust was left, revealed more often than not by
the junction of several roads. In the dip below lay Fricourt, to
the left Thiepval and Pozieres where bloody fights raged on July 1st.
Further away the green mass of Mametz Wood, still providing
excellent cover in spite of the thinning out it had undergone. Further
on lay Contalmaison, Montauban and the Bazentins, with Delville
Wood to the right, and there on the crown of the ridge a little
bunch of tree stumps marked the wood that was to be our goal, the
key to the desperate game that we were to play on the morrow.
The country seemed surprisingly difficult. A series of low hills and
ridges plentifully dotted with woods and villages and traversed
by numerous sunken roads, culminated in the ridge which overlooked
the plain of Bapaume. Most of that ridge was already ours,
but in many places the enemy still hung out with stubborn tenacity.
It looked terrible country to fight through&mdash;naturally strong and
made almost impregnable by German science and skill.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was realised that the Civil Service Rifles were about to go
through the most severe test in their history, by the side of
which Festubert, Loos, and even Vimy Ridge would be insignificant.
The thorough training which had just been completed,
however, had filled all ranks with confidence, and the
great Somme trek, which ended on the 14th of September with
the relief of the 1st Surrey Rifles in the front line trenches in
High Wood, brought to a close a period of training which for
really strenuous work has never been beaten. Some, in fact,
allege that the Division was overtrained at this time, and that
the “finishing school” at Franvillers had nearly finished them
off. But in spite of these allegations, it is believed that the
Battalion had never been better prepared for battle.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />

<span class="medium">HIGH WOOD</span></h2>

<p>What a wonderful scene it was along the New German Road
on the afternoon of the 14th of September&mdash;a never-ending
transport column moving along in broad daylight, conveying
ammunition and R.E. material for the big fight. An object
of special interest to the Civil Service Rifles was one of the
tanks which was passed on the road. The men studied it
critically and expressed a pious hope that it would turn up
all right on the day.</p>

<p>Although the road was so crowded with traffic, there was little
shelling, and after passing Bazentin-le-Grand the long communication
trench was entered and the front line reached without
loss.</p>

<p>High Wood was about the last vantage point that the enemy
held along the ridge. Only a few jagged trees remained and
the ground was littered with broken limbers and pitted with
innumerable shell holes which literally intersected one another.
Various trenches ran through the Wood, of which the greatest
part was held by the enemy.</p>

<p>The relief over, it became known that zero for the attack
would be at 5.50 a.m. on the morrow, and thereupon a weird
silence fell over all the area of the assembly trenches, where
the men were packed like sardines in a tin. Many chapters
have been written in an attempt to describe the eve of a battle,
but the finest description ever written falls very short of expressing
the feelings and thoughts of the men as they wait in their
assembly trenches for the dawn.</p>

<p>No attempt will be made here to describe the eve of High
Wood. Suffice it to say that it was a very quiet night; that
the troops, as they stood squashed up in Black Watch Trench,
fervently hoped that their fate on the morrow would be better
than that of the Battalion whose name the trench bore; and
that the only fellows who got any sleep were those who crept
out into No Man’s Land to lie down in shell holes. Rum was
issued at dawn, and after a sleepless night it was unusually
welcome.</p>

<p>And now zero hour approached, and thoughts turned to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
tanks, which were due to be on the German front line five minutes
before zero. The time drew nearer, but no tanks appeared,
and a few minutes before zero, Company Commanders received
a message telling them to send an officer to guide the tanks,
if seen. Thus, the Civil Service Rifles were handicapped at
the start, for the tanks were neither seen nor heard.</p>

<p>Owing to the irregular formation of the assembly trenches,
“B,” “C” and “D” Companies had been instructed to creep
out before zero, so that when the attack started they would be
forming a straight line with “A” Company, who were on the
extreme right. These Companies accordingly began to creep
up soon after 5.30 a.m. The fight, therefore, can be said to
have started well before zero, for at once as these men left their
trenches, German rifles opened fire, followed by machine guns,
and by zero hour the three left Companies of the Civil Service
Rifles, together with the Battalion on their left, were already
being treated to a murderous fire from a multitude of machine
guns and rifles in the German front line trenches. At the same
time down came the German artillery barrage on the assembly
trenches. As there was no artillery support whatever, the
attack at this point was held up, but not before about four-fifths
of “B,” “C,” and “D” Companies had been either killed
or wounded.</p>

<p>“A” Company, on the right, fared much better. They
did not leave their trenches until zero, and their course led
them out of the wood almost immediately. Consequently,
when they started, the German machine guns were already
busily occupied with the other Companies, and “A” Company
carried the first and second German trenches outside High Wood
with comparatively little loss. Arrived at the objective, a
certain amount of hand-to-hand fighting took place, in which
Sergeant H. B. Riddell and Second Lieutenant L. L. Burtt,
distinguished themselves, the former being chiefly instrumental
in putting a machine gun out of action, though he was wounded
in the fight.</p>

<p>The Battalion signallers following up “A” Company had
established a station in the captured trench, and as their lines
held for some time, the details of how “A” Company had
fared were quickly sent down to Battalion Headquarters.</p>

<p>“A” Company had already taken a number of prisoners,
and they now proceeded to bomb along the captured trench
towards where they expected to find “B” Company, but it was
soon realised that the other Companies had been held up. The
situation with these Companies was very grave. The Company
Commanders of “B” and “D” Companies, Captains Leslie
Davies and Arthur Roberts, had been killed, while Captain
Geoffrey Gaze, commanding “C” Company, was wounded, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
refused to go down. Captain Gaze, in fact, was the only officer
in these three Companies remaining at duty. A good many of
the senior N.C.O.’s had also been killed and wounded, but
thanks to the timely efforts of C.S.M. Brett of “D” Company,
C.S.M. Harris of “C” Company, and the surviving N.C.O.’s
of all three battered Companies, the remnants were formed up
again in the assembly positions, ready for another attempt.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the tanks had not shown up, though one of them
later on, after nearly smashing up Battalion Headquarters,
got stuck in a communication trench, and materially interfered
with the removal of the wounded. Its pilot got out, and, going
into Battalion Headquarters, asked the Commanding Officer
where High Wood was. Colonel Warrender’s reply is not
recorded.</p>

<p>The other tank eventually got into action somewhere in
front of “D” Company’s objective, and then caught fire.</p>

<p>At 11.0 a.m. the 140th Infantry Brigade Stokes mortar battery
came to the rescue. Captain Good, who was in command, had
had his guns on the spot overnight, and had been anxious to
give the attacking infantry some support. On the ground
that surprise was to be the key-note of the attack, however,
the authorities decided to keep the Stokes guns, like the artillery,
silent. Captain Good and his men responded magnificently
when they were given the permission they sought so eagerly,
and for twenty minutes, “feeding their voracious little pets with
bombs until they grew too hot to touch,” as De Ath says, the
battery put down such an accurate and intense bombardment
on the German front line that “C” and “D” Companies, when
they went forward again, carried their objectives without much
difficulty. The trench mortars had fired close on 800 rounds
in twenty minutes&mdash;a feat afterwards described by 4th Army
Headquarters as the most brilliant piece of work in the history
of trench mortars.</p>

<p>“C” Company was gallantly led for a second time by Captain
Gaze, but he was killed before reaching the objective.</p>

<p>By noon the whole of High Wood was in British possession,
together with what was known as the Switch Line beyond, and
the Civil Service Rifles had taken many prisoners and machine
guns. The price of victory, however, was terrible, and only
150 of the four Companies reached their objective.</p>

<p>The foregoing is an attempt at a description of the first phase
of the battle of High Wood, as it appeared to one who was
present on the spot. A well-known war correspondent seems
to have had a better view of the fight, for he related in detail
in a London newspaper how the tanks captured High Wood!</p>

<p>The first stage of the battle was over, but there was much
more to follow. The remnants of the Battalion advanced a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
little beyond the trench known as Switch Line and dug themselves
in in a new trench, and the afternoon was spent in hard
work in consolidating these positions, which were, however,
subject to considerable shelling by heavy artillery.</p>

<p>During the day the 6th and 8th Battalions had pushed through
to take trenches some distance beyond, known as the Flers Line
(connecting the village of Flers with Eaucourt L’Abb&eacute;), and
the Starfish, an intermediate line.</p>

<p>These operations only partially succeeded, so at 5.30 in the
evening of the 15th of September, the 1st Surrey Rifles, who
were in reserve, were sent out to attack the western half of the
Starfish Line and the strong point known as the Cough Drop.
The Civil Service Rifles were to occupy the Starfish when the
1st Surrey Rifles vacated it. The latter, however, on emerging
from High Wood in artillery formation, were immediately
caught by an intense enemy artillery and machine-gun barrage,
and the attack failed.</p>

<p>A similar experiment was tried at 9.0 a.m. the next morning
with the 23rd Battalion, but, although they advanced a considerable
distance, they were unable to reach the Flers Line.
The Boches, however, obliged by withdrawing to the Flers
Line, and the 6th and 8th Battalions occupied part of the Cough
Drop and the Starfish Line respectively. The 23rd Battalion
included two ex-Civil Service Riflemen in Major Kemble and
Second Lieutenant J. H. Hunt, who lost his life in this attack.
As a sergeant in “D” Company, J. H. Hunt had been exceptionally
popular, and the keenest regret was felt among his many
friends when he left to take his commission.</p>

<p>When darkness fell on the first night of the battle, the melancholy
work of the burial of the dead was begun. The special
party told off for this work dug graves in High Wood itself,
and all the dead who could be found were buried side by side
there.</p>

<p>The night of the 15th September presented a very striking
contrast to the previous night, when peace and quiet had reigned
in High Wood. The heavy artillery, with which the enemy
was so well supplied, pounded away continually at the new
trenches and at the supporting field gun batteries on the edge
of the wood. Amid the noise of the shells could often be heard
the groans of the wounded who had not yet been brought in,
the shouts of the search party of stretcher bearers, and the
curses of a ration or carrying party who had got lost. But
above all was the ceaseless wail of the field guns, echoing over
the wilderness. Listening to them on that night one could
almost imagine that they, too, were mourning for the gallant
fellows who had lost their lives that day, and who were now
being laid to rest. To many who were there the peculiar echo
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
of the field gun ever afterwards brought back vivid memories
of those terrible nights in High Wood.</p>

<p>There were many incidents and sights at High Wood which
left a lasting impression on the minds of the survivors. The
impressions of Corporal M. J. Guiton, of “C” Company, who
lost a leg there, are typical of many others in the Battalion:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“That day I saw sights which were passing strange to a man of
peace. I saw men in their madness bayonet each other without
mercy, without thought. I saw the hot life’s blood of German and
Englishman flow out together, and drench the fair soil of France.
I saw men torn to fragments by the near explosion of bombs, and&mdash;worse
than any sight&mdash;I heard the agonised cries and shrieks of men
in mortal pain who were giving up their souls to their Maker.</p>

<p>“The mental picture painted through the medium of the eye
may fade, but the cries of those poor, tortured and torn men I can
never forget: they are with me always. I would I had been deaf
at the time.”</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The day after the first attack was spent in the new trench,
where the garrison was shelled by heavy guns nearly all day.
The Adjutant, Lieutenant W. E. Ind, who had been full of
energy from the start, was a very frequent visitor, and in the
evening he brought the good news that the Battalion was to go
forward to occupy a trench which had deep dug-outs and which
wasn’t shelled. Tired as they were, the troops jumped at the
idea, and were ready in less than no time. The Adjutant led
the way in a pitch black darkness to the expected comfort,
which proved in the end to be a trench two feet deep, which had
been started by the Germans as a cable trench.</p>

<p>It had been reported that the 6th Battalion was holding the
Flers Line, and the Civil Service Rifles were accordingly going
to occupy Drop Alley, a communication trench leading from
the strong point called the Cough Drop to the Flers Line. But
on arrival at the Cough Drop, Lieutenant Ind found that the
report was untrue, and he had perforce to squeeze his small
body of men in the western half of the Cough Drop and the
afore-mentioned cable trench which ran out of it. It had been
a long and weary journey, but the men set to work like niggers
to dig a decent trench. There were now only two officers and
about 100 other ranks, but these included a good sprinkling of
seasoned warrant officers and N.C.O.’s, and the force made up
in quality what it lacked in quantity. C.S.M. Callingham and
Sergeant Irving of “A” Company had done their comrades a
very great service by struggling along with a jar of rum, which
was practically all that turned up that night in the shape of
rations, unless mention is to be made of rations sent up by a
thoughtful Quartermaster for the two officers&mdash;a bag of candles!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

<p>The process of digging in was no sooner finished than the
exhausted troops had to stand to for about an hour and a half,
on information from the 6th that the enemy was “coming over
in large numbers.”</p>

<p>So the day went on with a constant succession of alarms,
intense bombardments and standing to. It was indeed a trying
time for all that was left of the four Companies and Lewis gun
teams who, forty-eight hours ago, had been so full of hope.
But they all “stuck it” very valiantly, and the excellent spirits
of the men&mdash;prominent among whom were Lance-Corporal F. A.
Coward and his Lewis gun team, Privates Hundleby, Lynch,
and E. H. Lyons&mdash;together with the splendid example set by
Paddy Brett and Bob Harris, served to sustain the excellent
morale of the Civil Service Rifles. Special mention should be
made of the excellent patrol work done by Sergeant D. Gooding,
of “D” Company, who went out in broad daylight “to find
touch on the left.” The left flank of the position was exposed,
and it was not known whether friend or foe occupied the country
beyond. Sergeant Gooding, with two men, started off, therefore,
without any information and, although under rifle fire
from shell holes and isolated posts, they carried out a complete
reconnaissance of the country which separated the Civil Service
Rifles from the nearest friendly troops, four or five hundred
yards away. Many others of that little band distinguished
themselves by their devotion to duty during a day when there
was no communication of any kind from Battalion Headquarters,
and the party in the line became attached to the 6th Battalion
in the Cough Drop.</p>

<p>On the 18th, a small reinforcement arrived in the shape of
three officers&mdash;Lieutenants W. L. C. Rathbone, G. M. Hoste,
and B. K. Ware, and fifty other ranks, from the “Non Starters”
camp in Bottom Wood, where a few officers and other ranks
had been kept out of the fight in order to form a nucleus for
reorganisation in case of heavy losses.</p>

<p>Before being relieved on the night of the 19th September
by the 1st Battalion The Black Watch, the Civil Service Rifles
undertook two more operations. The first was an advance
into the Flers Line on the 18th, but as the enemy had by now
evacuated this trench, the advance passed off without loss.</p>

<p>But the enemy still held the junction of the Flers Line and
Drop Alley, and that portion of the Flers Line west of the
junction. The New Zealanders had a party in the Flers Line
between the Bosches and the Civil Service Rifles, but the Civil
Service Rifles had a small force under Lieutenant B. K. Ware
in Drop Alley. These two forces attempted, by joint bombing
attacks, to dislodge the Bosches, but the attempt failed. The
men were now thoroughly exhausted, for in addition to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
enormous amount of work of the past few days and the excitement
of the fray, the last twenty-four hours had been endured
in a pitiless rain, which caused huge chunks of the trenches
to give way. There was mud and rain everywhere and, as there
was no shelter, rifles and Lewis guns eventually became choked
with mud. It was while in this state that the enemy attempted
to drive Lieutenant Ware’s party out of Drop Alley. He
partially succeeded at first, but was afterwards driven back.
But at 7.0 p.m. on the 19th, he came again with renewed vigour,
and got down Drop Alley, where the defending troops, with
rifles and Lewis guns out of action, and themselves quite worn
out, were unable to dislodge him. They did not give up without
a struggle, however, and Lieutenant Ware died that night in a
plucky attempt to achieve the impossible. Thus ended the
operations of the Civil Service Rifles at High Wood, but it was
indeed a skeleton of a battalion that Lieut.-Colonel Warrender
led down the New German Road to Bottom Wood on the morning
of the 20th September. Round a huge bonfire these remnants
threw themselves down to get their first rest since leaving
Becourt Wood, and here a pause was made to count the cost
of what was so far the greatest trial of the Civil Service Rifles
and, at the same time, surely their greatest achievement.</p>

<p>To this day, High Wood is regarded by many as the finest
performance of the Battalion during the war. But whether
this is true or no, it is certain that this battle was the most
distinctive landmark in the history of the Civil Service Rifles,
for it was at High Wood where the first great changes took place
in the personnel of the Battalion. Some say it was the last of
the original Battalion, but such a statement is open to question.</p>

<p>Many old faces had gone, but the old spirit still remained,
and there were enough old hands left to train drafts in the way
they should go, and to tell them what manner of men they had
been whose places these freshmen had the honour to fill.</p>

<p>There fell during the fighting at High Wood, so many of the
real flower of the Battalion that it is impossible to do justice
to them by any eulogy here, and it would be invidious to single
out any in particular among so many illustrious dead. Their
names will all be found recorded elsewhere. Suffice it to say
that they died like the true Englishmen of tradition, every one
gallantly and gamely carrying on against odds. In the four
days the casualties amounted to 15 officers, 365 other ranks.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />

<span class="medium">EAUCOURT L’ABBE AND THE BUTTE DE WARLENCOURT</span></h2>

<p>The so-called camp in Bottom Wood was the essence of discomfort,
but after a meal and a few hours rest, a welcome move
was made in the evening of the 20th September to Albert, where
one night was spent in deserted houses.</p>

<p>The march was continued the following day, and the Battalion
arrived at a tented camp in a wood just outside the village of
Henencourt, where Corps Headquarters was situated in a
magnificent ch&acirc;teau, the grounds of which were a replica of
those of the Palace of Versailles. There was little to suggest
the luxury of Versailles, however, in the camp occupied by the
Civil Service Rifles, for although the Battalion was depleted,
the accommodation was scarce and every one was crowded.</p>

<p>The process of refitting and reorganisation was begun, and to
a draft of one officer and 375 other ranks, who joined at Henencourt
was added a fair sprinkling of officers, N.C.O.’s and men
who had missed High Wood through leave, courses, or other
causes. Thus the strength of the Battalion was restored on
paper, but in actual fact it was still but a shadow of its former
self.</p>

<p>The officers spent most of their time at Henencourt Wood in
writing letters of condolence to bereaved parents, and the
Company Quartermaster Sergeants and senior N.C.O.’s were
busy packing up and sending off the personal effects of the
killed and wounded, so that on the whole, the ten days’ sojourn
in this camp was not a joyous one. The Divisional Follies tried
to cheer things up by giving a show one evening, but the proceedings
fell flat, and those who wanted a little diversion while
the Battalion was at Henencourt sought it in Amiens.</p>

<p>The last day of the month of September, 1916, found the
Civil Service Rifles once more on the way back to war, for after
spending one night in Albert, they occupied some disused
trenches, entirely devoid of dug-outs, in what was known as
the Quadrangle, near Mametz Wood. Here they waited eagerly
for news of the attack by the 141st Brigade on the village of
Eaucourt L’Abb&eacute;, for which the 140th Brigade was in reserve.</p>

<p>Numerous contradictory reports reached Colonel Warrender
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
during the few days spent in the Quadrangle, but at last it
became known definitely that Eaucourt L’Abb&eacute; had been
captured, and that the 140th Brigade would go there to relieve
the 141st, but would only hold the line&mdash;there would not be any
further attack!</p>

<p>The relief which took place on the night of the 4th October,
when the Civil Service Rifles relieved the Poplar and Stepney
Rifles in the Flers Line at Eaucourt L’Abb&eacute;, was an ordeal
almost as trying as a battle.</p>

<p>The march from the Quadrangle began at 4.0 p.m. on the 4th,
and the tail of the Battalion reached the Flers Line at dawn
the next day. The event was so unique that no apology is
offered for a somewhat lengthy description:&mdash;</p>

<p>All was going well until the corner of High Wood was reached,
where, according to plan, guides would be picked up. There
were, however, several corners to High Wood, and the Lewis
gun limbers, mess cart and medical cart were not taken to the
same corner as the one to which the Battalion went.</p>

<p>After a very long delay, while Lewis guns, etc., were carried
through the wood from the limbers to the Battalion over many
awkward obstacles such as wide trenches and barbed wire, a
start was made by half the Battalion, and about two hours
afterwards the remainder of the Battalion was ready. The
way was along a track of sticky mud of the typical Somme
variety. The night was pitch black and the men slipped about
and frequently their feet stuck in the mud. It was often necessary
for two men to pull at another man to get him out of the
mud, and as they got their man out they found themselves stuck
in in turn. At one time Colonel Warrender was heard to tell
the M.O. that a man had fallen down, but he feared it was no
use going back to him “as he must have been trampled in by
now.” The progress along the track, slow as it was, became
slower still when one after another the guides announced that
they were lost and had not the slightest idea in which direction
to go. A touch of humour crept into the adventure when
Colonel Warrender, addressing a guide who said he hadn’t the
remotest idea where he was, told him to go back to his Commanding
Officer and report that he was of no use!</p>

<p>After many hours the Cough Drop was reached by the party
bringing up the rear, which included Battalion Headquarters,
and here one of the other Companies was met coming in the
opposite direction. They, too, had a guide who was lost. The
Adjutant now took up the running alone and plunged into the
darkness on an exploring tour. He soon came back, and then
led the whole party, now consisting of a good many more than
half the Battalion, through Drop Alley to the Flers Line. The
going now began to tell on the exhausted troops and several
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
there were who collapsed unconscious in Drop Alley, weighed
down by the heavy loads they were carrying, and did not finish
their journey until the following day.</p>

<p>The Flers Line is chiefly remembered for the number of dead,
both English and German, who were still lying about on the
floor of the trench and on all the firesteps. There were a few
hurriedly-made dug-outs, but these were in such a filthy state
as to be unfit to occupy, and although much hard work was done
for the next two days, the cleaning of the trench was still unfinished
when the troops learnt to their astonishment, on the
7th of October, that they were to attack the Butte de Warlencourt
and the Warlencourt Line&mdash;an objective some 2,800 yards
distant.</p>

<p>Zero was at 2.0 p.m., and the Companies occupied the same
relative positions as at High Wood, “A” Company again being
on the right. The three Companies on the left were unfortunate
once more, for they had to file through the village of Eaucourt
l’Abb&eacute; soon after leaving their assembly trenches and extend
into waves again after negotiating the village. They were
caught by the full fury of the German artillery barrage, and
those who got through the village were swept down by a most
intense machine-gun fire. “A” Company on the right made
some little progress, and after crossing the Eaucourt l’Abb&eacute;-Le
Barque road dug a new line alongside the remnants of other
units of the Division, all of whom had met a similar fate. Another
attempt was made at night by the 142nd Brigade, but as these
troops had not even seen the country in daylight, their attempt
failed so completely that they were all withdrawn shortly after
zero.</p>

<p>The attack on the Butte de Warlencourt failed, like many
attacks subsequently delivered by other Divisions, and the
famous Butte did not fall into English hands until the German
retreat from the Somme battlefield during the winter of 1916-17.</p>

<p>The attack of the 7th of October differed in many respects
from that of the 15th of September. On this occasion there
had been no training, no rehearsal over a marked-out course,
and in fact some of the troops did not even know there was to be
an attack until an hour or so before zero. Even then there
were many who were not sure what was the objective. To this
day there are some in the Civil Service Rifles who talk of it
as the attack on Eaucourt l’Abb&eacute;. There was an artillery
creeping barrage on this occasion, it is true, but as it moved at
the rate of 100 yards per minute and there were 2,800 yards
between the jumping-off trenches and the objective, the advancing
waves of infantry soon got badly left behind. Tanks
were said to be co-operating, but nothing was seen of them.</p>

<p>There were only two officers per Company present on this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
occasion, and the C.S.M. and one or two senior N.C.O.’s of
each Company were kept out of the fight, so the experienced
soldier was in a distinct minority. More than half of the Battalion
had never been under fire before, and, as these had only joined
a few days previously, a good many of them were not known
even by name to the older members of their Platoons. Thus
it came about that many men were reported missing on this
occasion, and, as none of the survivors knew them, it was impossible
to say with any certainty where they had last been
seen.</p>

<p>The losses on the 7th of October amounted to five officers,
344 other ranks, and although numerically they are not quite
so great as at High Wood, it should be remembered that on this
occasion the Battalion was not more than 500 strong at the
outset.</p>

<p>During the operations around Eaucourt l’Abb&eacute; there was
one member of the regiment who added to his already brilliant
reputation as a soldier. The work of Lieutenant W. E. Ind
on this occasion was more than wonderful. Quickly grasping the
situation when the attack failed, by his hard work and resourcefulness
he succeeded in restoring something like order out of
chaos, not only in his own unit but also in several neighbouring
units.</p>

<p>The relief by the 7th Seaforth Highlanders on the 9th of
October was a welcome contrast to the previous relief in this
sector. The troops quickly found their way out and before
midnight had reached the transport lines in Bottom Wood.</p>

<p>Three nights were spent in Albert before the Division entrained
on the 13th of October for Longpr&eacute;, near Abbeville,
en route for the Ypres Salient.</p>

<p>Before leaving Albert, the Quartermaster aroused the wrathful
indignation of the C.Q.M.S.’s by the issue of a quantity of clothing
and equipment which had been applied for at Henencourt.
Many of the men for whom it was intended had now become
casualties, but that made no difference to the Quartermaster’s
stores of the Civil Service Rifles. The most important article
of clothing was the clean shirt which was issued just before
leaving Albert. The troops had not had a clean shirt for many
weeks, and the one they discarded was naturally somewhat
the worse for wear. One C.Q.M.S. on inquiring at the Orderly
Room what should be done with the old shirts was told by an
Orderly Room clerk to burn them. The clerk was trying to
be funny, but the Q.M.S. missed the point of his humour, and
all Companies thereupon threw their old shirts on the dust
heap. When he was demobilised some years later the C.Q.M.S.
was still explaining to the authorities why he had destroyed
his ultra lousy shirts.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<p>The train journey from Albert to Longpr&eacute; is surely a record
even for the R.O.D. A distance of just over thirty miles was
covered in the astonishingly short time of twenty-six hours,
during which time many men had left the train, dined in Amiens,
visited the local cinema, and still caught the train up again
without being recorded as absent. Indeed, during one part
of the journey there seemed to be more men walking than were
riding. At the same time every one seemed conscious of the
fact that he had said good-bye to the dreaded Somme battlefield,
so few felt disposed to complain of the shortcomings of
the R.O.D.</p>

<p>After detraining at Longpr&eacute;, two happy days were spent
in the village of Villers-sous-Ailly. The men received a hearty
welcome from the natives and M. le Maire, who seemed to be the
greatest French authority on the organisation of an English
infantry battalion. This worthy was very popular with the
billeting party, for he had his village completely mapped out,
and could tell them whether a particular barn was big enough
to hold a platoon, a section, or a Lewis gun team.</p>

<p>The Battalion returned to Longpr&eacute; on the 16th of October
and entrained for Caestre, which was reached in the early hours
of the following morning, whence a long and uninteresting
march brought the Battalion to scattered billets outside the
village of Boeschepe, and after another long march on the 19th,
the Civil Service Rifles relieved the 16th Battalion Australian
Infantry in support to what was called the Bluff Sub-sector (or
Canal Sub-sector) south of Ypres, and close to what had once
been the Ypres-Comines canal.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />

<span class="medium">A REST CURE IN THE YPRES SALIENT</span></h2>

<p>To those whose memories of Ypres are only associated with
thoughts of mud and slaughter, and who at the mention of the
word “Salient” instinctively think of the horrors of Passchendaele,
the Menin Road and Hooge, it will seem incredible that
there was a time during the war when the Ypres Salient was
peaceful and quiet, a place where Divisions, shattered on the
Somme, came for recuperation.</p>

<p>It was in such a state that the 47th Division found the Ypres
Salient in October, 1916, and after what had been endured in
the previous month, it was particularly welcome.</p>

<p>In the Civil Service Rifles reconstruction had only just begun.
No drafts had reached the Battalion, which was very much below
strength. Some Companies had only one officer, the Company
Commander, and practically no N.C.O.’s above the rank of
Lance-Corporal. It was well, therefore, that there was no
fighting and the sound of a shell was the exception rather than
the rule.</p>

<p>The Division had had no experience of trench warfare for
some months, and when the Civil Service Rifles on the 24th of
October, 1916, relieved the Post Office Rifles in the front line
in what was called the Ravine, a section of the Bluff Sector,
they found several features of trench warfare which were quite
new to them.</p>

<p>In the first place, each Company had a cookhouse in the
trenches, and the Company cooks came in with their Companies
and cooked all the meals on the spot. Rations were pushed
up almost to Company Headquarters in trucks along a light
railway, and there was a dump of R.E. material actually in
the Battalion area. These were all amenities of trench life
hitherto unknown, and all helped to convey the idea that the
Civil Service Rifles were making a new start in life. These
conditions helped materially to restore the confidence and
fighting spirit of troops who were rapidly approaching the
“fed-up” state.</p>

<p>The trenches were mostly sandbagged barricades such as
had been seen as Festubert, but here they were neatly revetted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
with expanded metal, and although there was a good deal of
water, all the trench floors were boarded. There were recesses
labelled for bombs and S.A.A., and although the trench shelters
were not by any means shell-proof, the majority at least were
weatherproof.</p>

<p>There were many ambitious schemes for winter comforts.
A Brigade gum boot store with lots of thigh gum boots was
already established, and large shelters were being erected in
each Battalion area as drying rooms, where men would be able
to dry their clothes. These shelters, however, never got into
working order. Another novelty was the precaution taken
to prevent trench feet or frost bite. It was arranged that
every man should change his socks and rub his feet with whale
oil every day, the old socks being sent down every night and
exchanged at the Divisional Laundry for alleged clean ones
which were brought up with rations the following night.</p>

<p>Thus it was hoped to combat some of the evils which beset
the Army during the previous winter, and there is no doubt that
these measures bore good fruit, for the losses through sickness
during the winter of 1916-17 were less than half those of the
previous winter.</p>

<p>But although the prospect at the beginning of winter was
very bright, and the troops were looking forward confidently
to a spell of quiet life, it was not long before things began to
liven up, as though the Ypres Salient had begun to look to its
reputation.</p>

<p>The change was first noticeable when, on returning to the
front line after a few days in Divisional Reserve at Ottawa
Camp, near the village of Ouderdom, the Battalion took over a
section of the front line in what was called the Hill 60 Sector,
on the 13th of November.</p>

<p>These trenches differed in many respects from those in the
Ravine, in spite of the fact that they were practically adjacent.
Mining activities were carried on here on a very elaborate scale,
and there were several deep tunnels, some, it was said, running
as far forward as the German front line on Hill 60 itself. These
tunnels were all being worked by one of the Australian Tunnelling
Companies, to whom working parties were sent day and
night. The main line of the Ypres-Roulers railway ran through
the sector, and the old railway cutting formed the right boundary
of the Battalion front. The trenches had been in existence
for many months, and owing to the continual bombardments,
the ravages of weather, and the quaint ideas of sanitation of
former occupants of the sector, the area could hardly claim
to be a health resort. Large fat rats abounded in and around
every trench, and so fat were they that they had lost their turn
of speed, and fell easy victims to any who could find time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
to hunt them. Bully beef and Maconochie’s famous meat
and vegetable rations were to be found everywhere. Some men
say that these were often used in place of trench boards.</p>

<p>Those working in the tunnels with the Australians were
impressed, almost awestruck, by the magnitude of the mining
operations, which they felt sure would end one day in a miniature
earthquake, and they fervently hoped they would be at a safe
distance when that should happen. The tunnels were lighted
by electricity, the power for which was produced by a gas engine
installed underground. A privileged few were allowed to
explore the wonderful Berlin Sap, a long tunnel which stretched
from some distance in rear of Battalion Headquarters to the
German lines.</p>

<p>But it must not be imagined that the troops enjoyed home
comforts in this area. The Companies holding the left of the
Battalion front had practically no protection from either shell
fire or weather, and those who have occupied the curiously-named
Metropolitan Left and Metropolitan Right will be ready
to swear that there was no more miserable place on the western
front. They were, however, little better off than those who were
stowed away in the tunnels of Marshall Walk, where the atmosphere
reduced the occupants, packed in tight, to a state of coma.</p>

<p>The enemy had now begun to bombard the area fiercely
with various kinds of shells and minenwerfer bombs, but fortunately
he was kind enough, at first at all events, to limit his
bombardments strictly to certain hours of the day. His special
effort was always served up during the two hours after lunch,
and strangely enough it was mostly bestowed on the Marshall
Walk area, where the troops were able to squeeze into the
tunnels. The men in other parts of the line had to sit under a
ground sheet or a bit or corrugated iron and hope that nothing
would come their way. In this way five somewhat anxious
days were endured with comparatively few casualties before
the Battalion moved into support in another of the wonders
of the Ypres Salient&mdash;the Railway Dug-outs. These were dug-outs
formed by tunnelling into the railway embankment between
the village of Zillebeke and Ypres itself. Half the Battalion
was accommodated here, the men occupying wire beds which
were erected in tiers. The atmosphere was thick, to say the
least, and fatigue parties were frequently told off to try to fan
the foul air out with gas fans. The other two Companies were
at Battersea Farm and Ch&acirc;teau Belge.</p>

<p>The Railway Dug-outs area had its advantages, however, for
there was little shelling and there were opportunities during
the day to wander out into the fresh air, to visit the Brigade
canteen, and sometimes to visit the ruins of the historic city
of Ypres. The working parties at night were employed in pushing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
trucks of R.E. material along what remained of the railway
line to the ration dump of the front line Battalion, in the
Hill 60 sector. On the whole the five days at Railway Dug-outs
were written down as not too bad, and after five more
days in the front line in Hill 60 sector, the end of November
saw the Battalion in Divisional Reserve in the huts at Ottawa
Camp.</p>

<p>The Division had now settled down to a very stereotyped
form of warfare, and as there seemed every likelihood that no
move would take place for some months, an elaborate programme
of work for improving the accommodation both in
trenches and camps was embarked upon.</p>

<p>There were two Brigades holding the line and one in reserve
occupying four hutted camps in the neighbourhood of the
villages of Ouderdom and Busseboom. It was arranged that
whenever a Brigade was in reserve, the various Battalions
should always go to the same camp. So it came about that
the Civil Service Rifles always went to Ottawa Camp. This
arrangement, it was hoped, would encourage Battalions to work
hard at camp improvements. Works Officers were appointed
and pioneer platoons were detailed in each Company for this
purpose, but every time the Civil Service Rifles returned to
Ottawa Camp they swore no work had been done since they
were last there.</p>

<p>Somebody did work in Ottawa Camp, however, for in course
of time it became transformed from the sea of mud, with a
collection of broken-down, draughty huts, into a tolerably
comfortable camp&mdash;if any camp in Belgium could be comfortable.
The Battalion Mess for sergeants was revived, and under the
stewardship of Sergeant R. F. M. Bigby, a fairly successful
attempt was made to restore the former glory of the Civil
Service Rifles Sergeants’ Mess.</p>

<p>In looking back on the year spent in the Ypres Salient, the
average member of the Civil Service Rifles, full of the bitter
memories of the Menin Road, Hooge and Ch&acirc;teau Wood, is
apt to forget that there was a time when life was quite enjoyable
in Ottawa Camp, with the trips to Poperinghe, where there was
much gaiety.</p>

<p>It is quite true, however, that at first Ottawa Camp was
better known for its discomfort than for anything else, and it
was a curious fact that Halifax Camp, which was the home of
one of the Support Battalions of a Brigade holding the front
line, was much more comfortable.</p>

<p>The month of December 1916 is chiefly notable for the
formation of what was known as the “football team”&mdash;two
officers (Second Lieutenants H. S. Gosney and C. E. Groves)
and fifty other ranks. This team began to train for a raid on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
the German trenches, when they hoped to atone for the ill-luck
which had attended previous Civil Service Rifles’ raids.</p>

<div id="i127" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i127.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Sketch Map to illustrate the twelve months in the Ypres Salient October 1916-September 1917.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The party was housed in reserve dug-outs in the trenches
about Ch&acirc;teau S&eacute;gard, one of the support positions for the
Ravine sector, and in addition to training in the surrounding
trenches after dark, parties went up to the front line nightly to
patrol No Man’s Land and inspect the enemy wire.</p>

<p>The scheme was entered into with enthusiasm by the whole
party, which was split up into six groups, each with a definite
job to do, and they were all brim full of confidence when, at
5.45 p.m. on the 23rd of December, they set out from the front
line on their adventure&mdash;to the strains of music from a violin
in the German lines!</p>

<p>The troops entered the German front line safely enough
and worked their way round the appointed area. The
opposition, not very strong, was quickly overcome, but no
prisoners could be brought back. Two Bosches did get as far
as the parapet but there they decided to stay, and as nothing
would induce them to come over, “they had to be disposed of,”
as one of the N.C.O.’s afterwards said in his report.</p>

<p>The return home at the appointed time was carried out
successfully and as numerous identifications were brought back,
the object of the raid had been achieved. The casualties were
very few, but unfortunately they included two killed&mdash;Lance-Corporal
A. T. C. Geary and Private A. F. Pearson.</p>

<p>The success of the raid put the whole party in good spirits
for Christmas, which, as in 1915, was spent in the trenches.
The Christmas celebrations duly took place, however, early in
January at Ottawa Camp, when each Company had a Christmas
dinner and concert. The festival lacked nothing on account
of the postponement, and in many sections of the Battalion it
was kept up for several days. To celebrate their success the
survivors of the raid were given a dinner at which the heroes
of the evening were Lance-Sergeant H. J. Steele and Corporal
J. H. Swain, who had both been awarded the M.M.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />

<span class="medium">THE SALIENT IN WINTER</span></h2>

<p>Life in the Ypres Salient could now no longer be described as a
rest cure, for in addition to increased activity on both sides in
the line, the weather was of the real wintry type.</p>

<p>The trenches, where there had been “water, water, everywhere,”
had become ice-bound, and remained so for many
weeks. Trench stores were often taken over by a C.S.M. who
could scarcely see them through the ice, but who was told that
he would “find they were all right when the thaw came.”</p>

<p>To complete the wintry scene, snow had fallen and cast a
mantle of white over the ugly sights of war. The Ravine
certainly looked pretty now, with the feathery snowflakes
glistening on the trees, and here and there an icicle giving the
genuine Christmas-card impression. No Man’s Land, too, has
rarely looked more picturesque with the festoons of barbed wire
daintily picked out in white. Yes, it was a beautiful scene on
a moonlight night in January 1917, but the sentry on the
firestep in the front line, with feet frozen, nose, ears and hands
feeling as though they were about to drop off, had no eye for
such beauty. His idea of beauty at the time was a little so-called
dug-out, with a ground sheet or an old post bag (contrary
to G.R.O. “XYZ”) hanging over the entrance, and inside a
glorious warm “fug” with three or four of his pals stewing in
the fumes given off by a tiny brazier. It was so cold on the
firestep and the front line trenches were so near to each other,
that he daren’t stamp his feet, for fear of being heard in the
German line. Not that it mattered a great deal about being
heard, thought the sentry, for with his hands in such a frozen
state that he did not know whether he was holding his rifle or
not, he couldn’t do much to stop the Bosche if he did come over
to-night. Things would not be much better when the Battalion
was relieved. He supposed it would be Ottawa Camp again,
where it was bitterly cold and the Quartermaster would never
give you any fuel. Why couldn’t he have a job like “Posh
Harry” at the Brigade School, he wondered? At any rate,
there would be a comfortable billet there, and a fire. He must
get a stripe, that’s what it came to, and then if he could not get
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
a job at the Brigade School or at the Divisional School in
Poperinghe, at any rate he might get sent there on a course.
He was fed up with this life, he was sure, and when his turn of
sentry duty was finished and he was promptly put on an ice-breaking
fatigue, he began to think that there was some sense
after all in the peace talk that one read of in the newspapers
at this time. If only they would talk about it seriously! But
what could one expect when the newspaper folk described the
peace talk as “an insult to Tommy in the trenches”?</p>

<p>Meditations such as the foregoing were not uncommon in the
early part of 1917, when the wintry weather was almost the
sole topic of conversation. But what was dreaded more than
the frost and snow was the thaw which would follow, and how
every man prayed that his Battalion would move into Divisional
Reserve the day the thaw came!</p>

<p>Before the thaw came, however, the Civil Service Rifles were
to have a little excitement in the front line, for one night in the
middle of January, the Bosche, who had evidently been reading
the story of the escape of Mary Queen of Scots from Lochleven
Castle, had attired his patrols in white raiment and sent them
out across the snow. The trick came off, and the Bosches
entered the trench known as Berry Post, inflicted casualties on
the garrison, and got back to their own lines unhurt.</p>

<p>This feat so impressed the authorities that by the time the
thaw had fairly set in, white patrol jackets were awaiting
collection from ordnance.</p>

<p>Many Transport men have unpleasant recollections of nights
on this sector, where rations were taken up to the front line in
trucks drawn by mules on the light railways from Woodcote
Farm. In theory, loaded trucks were picked up at the Farm
and hauled to the Ravine or elsewhere, there unloaded, and
taken back to be ready for use next day. In practice, the
trucks were usually at the wrong end of the railway to start
with; and when obtained they invariably came off the rails at
intervals on the up-journey&mdash;to a chorus of curses from the
accompanying fatigue party. Drivers have bitter memories of
nights when shelling occurred while trucks were off the rails.
They admit that it was only human for the fatigue party to go
to ground; but they still cannot see how one man could be
expected to manage a distracted mule and also unload, re-rail
and re-load a truck of trenchboards.</p>

<p>It was here that Onions, chief Bolshevik of the Battalion
mules was lost. After the line had been broken by shell-fire,
she was sent up at dawn to bring back stranded trucks. Enemy
observers traced her back to Brisbane Dump and sent out an
S.O.S. reporting her presence there. Onions left hastily with
a dislike of barrage fire and a wound in the head, and was sent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
forthwith to the Base to be seen no more by the Civil Service
Rifles.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Small drafts were continually arriving during the winter of
1916-17, and they often included several old N.C.O.’s and
men of the original Battalion, who were coming out for their
second trip to France. Such men were generally given a rousing
send off by their companions at Hazeley Down Camp, Winchester,
where the Reserve Battalion was stationed. The war cry of
the returned warriors at the time was “Everybody once, before
anybody twice” and the unofficial flag, known as the “Twicers”
Flag, which was usually carried aloft on the march to the station,
has since been framed, and now hangs in the Civil Service Rifles’
Club to commemorate the once famous “F” Company of the
Civil Service Rifles Reserve Battalion.</p>

<p>For some unknown reason the officers joining the Battalion
belonged to regiments outside London. There were representatives
of the various Battalions of the Manchester Regiment,
the Northern Cyclists and the Hampshire Regiment. In fact,
so many changes had taken place among the officers of the
Battalion, that by February, 1917, not a single one remained
of those who had embarked as officers in March 1915.</p>

<p>An interesting innovation during the early weeks of 1917, was
the starting of a Regimental Drum and Fife Band. The R. S. M.
called it a Corps of Drums, the troops knew it at first as those &mdash;&mdash;
tin whistles, but under the leadership of Sergeant Drummer
Harmon, the Regimental Band became an accomplished fact,
and the Civil Service Rifles had music on the march for the first
time since coming to France&mdash;except for the early spring of
1916, when “Mattie” Hull conducted a mouth organ and tin
whistle band among the Lewis gunners.</p>

<p>A change from the eternal round of trench life came about
towards the end of February, when it fell to the lot of the Civil
Service Rifles to act for one month as Works Battalion in the
Tenth Corps area. The Companies were scattered over a very
wide area, “A” being at Ch&acirc;teau Belge, near Kruistraathoeke,
“B” at Coppernollehoek and Poperinghe, “C” at Pacific
Sidings between Busseboom and Poperinghe, and “D” at
Vancouver Camp, close to Vlamertinghe. Battalion Headquarters
remained at Ottawa Camp. The Companies were
employed daily on working parties, chiefly under the Canadian
Railway Construction Company, on work connected with the
laying of a light railway from Poperinghe to the forward area.
After the discomforts of trench life, the change was very welcome,
particularly with “B” Company, who had rather wonderful
billets, and “C” Company, who were all under one roof within
easy distance of Poperinghe.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>

<p>The Companies were still scattered on the 17th of March, so
it was not possible for the Battalion to celebrate the day with
a united gathering, but “C” Company had a very successful
show at Pacific Siding which was attended by representatives
from all the other Companies. The Sergeants held a belated
but very hearty celebration on another day, and a party from
“B” Company held a dinner in Poperinghe.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Throughout the first six months of the time spent in the
Ypres Salient, the Transport Lines were established at a typical
Belgian farm, and consequently no gathering of Transport
men is now complete without a few tales of Delanotte Farm.</p>

<p>In addition to the Transport, the Quartermaster and his staff
spent a good deal of their time at Delanotte Farm, where also
the Civil Service Rifles’ dentist, Corporal E. Pitt, was installed
with all his stock in trade. The Civil Service Rifles claim to be
unique among Infantry Battalions in the B. E. F. in that they
alone possessed their own dentist, who, although fully qualified,
was primarily an infantryman and was not one of the R. A. M. C.
attached.</p>

<p>During his service in France, Corporal Pitt has attended to
a distinguished clientele, including at least one Brigadier
General, but he showed no class distinctions in his dental chair,
and the humble private was always sure of just as careful
treatment as was given to his Brigadier.</p>

<p>Pitt often had to work amid strange surroundings, but his
surgery at Delanotte Farm was perhaps his best known home,
and one of his patients has recorded his impressions of it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In the last great European War the ambitious Emperor who
may be regarded as the Kaiser’s prototype stated that an army
marched on its stomach. But what is a stomach without its teeth?
(vide any advertisements of ‘a complete set from one guinea
upwards’). At any rate the British Army has come to regard the
teeth of its lads as anxiously as the fond mother regards her little
one’s chewing organs. These few remarks will serve to introduce
our hero.</p>

<p>“Imagine a brick farm-house in a part of Belgium where the mud
is too muddy for words. The house nestles in a swamp of green
viscous slime. This was for many months the locale of the C. S. R.
Transport while the boys were disporting themselves in the ditches
(misnamed ‘trenches’) in the Ypres district. <i>The</i> room of the
farmhouse was of fairly decent size, with a low ceiling supported
by stout smoke-grimed beams. It was always well patronised by
the lads of the Transport, who would discuss the inevitable eggs and
chips and sip their coffee or beer all day long. At a large sink by
the window the good lady of the house, assisted variously by a
submissive husband, a daughter (who could by no stretch of imagination
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
be called a coquette!) and a son, seemed eternally engaged
either in preparing a salad of chickweed and groundsel (or so it
seemed), or in counting the stock of dried haricots. In the other
corner by the window, there was a complete dental establishment
installed. This was the scene of the labours of the indefatigable
Pitt, and there was nothing of the horse-doctor’s methods about
him. I can assure you that he wielded the cocaine-injecting needle
as expertly as the one and only Sherlock himself. Did you want a
tooth scraped or stopped, or filled, or coddled in any way whatever,
our dentist would say ‘right,’ and place a fresh cigarette in his
holder (would that I received a royalty on the cigarettes he smoked!)
Then he would select some fearsome-looking&mdash;but really harmless&mdash;instruments
from his plenteous stock, and carry on. His sideline
(something like the ‘making bricks in spare time’ stunt) was
treating cases that would ordinarily fall to the care of the M.O.
if he were available. It was surprising how the fame of Pitt spread
near and far; and many and various were his clients. The amusing
part was the complete nonchalance of the people of the house.
They would carry on their weird and wonderful culinary processes
at the sink while the amateur doctor extracted teeth and poured
away bloody water and rinsed foul dressings under their very noses.
In this atmosphere of eggs and chips, steaming coffee, stale beer,
tobacco smoke, flies, and sometimes washing, Pitt carried on his
labours day by day, month by month, until the Battalion was sent
away to happier (?) hunting grounds....</p>

<p>“Jolly old Pitt! How many of us had cause to bless the fact
that we could go to him for healing balm in our time of bitter
sorrow!”</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Battalion was reassembled after being employed for a
month as Works Battalion, and on the 21st of March renewed
its acquaintance with the front line trenches in the Ravine.
The trenches were no longer ice-bound, but the official first day
of Spring did not live up to its name, for snow and sleet fell
throughout the night. Eight uneventful days in the Ravine
were followed by a similar period in support in the neighbourhood
of Swan Ch&acirc;teau and Ch&acirc;teau Segard. Hitherto when the
Battalion had been at Swan Ch&acirc;teau the chief recreation had
been sliding on the pond in the ch&acirc;teau grounds. Captain Ind,
in fact, made a nightly practice of leading Headquarter Company
in sliding on the ice by moonlight. On this occasion, however,
boating and fishing were freely indulged in. There was an
odd looking craft on the pond, which was in great demand, and
the most popular bait for the fish seemed to be a Mills bomb&mdash;though
this bait was not sanctioned by the B. E. F. Angling
Society. It was in fact forbidden by G.R.O., so it naturally
follows that no angler was ever known to use the bait.</p>

<p>Any man who thought the Battalion had come to the Ypres
Salient for boating and fishing, however, was rudely disillusioned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
when a return was made to the front line in the familiar Ravine.
The London Irish had just finished a big raid on the German
lines when the Civil Service Rifles relieved them on the night of
the 7th of April, and henceforth things livened up very considerably
in this sector, where life had previously been tolerably
quiet. The Bosche now bombarded furiously, and on the 9th
of April (Easter Monday) he raided the Battalion on the
immediate left of the Civil Service Rifles, causing pretty heavy
casualties. The raid took place at 6.30 p.m. and the accompanying
fireworks were kept up throughout the night. As a sample
of the frightfulness that could be served up in the Salient, it
was fairly complete, and the Civil Service Rifles, although not
in the raided trenches, lost thirteen killed and eighteen wounded
during the night.</p>

<p>The Division very soon afterwards had to take over a little
more of the line immediately south of the Ypres-Comines
Canal, known as the Spoil Bank Sector, and as it meant giving
up the hated Hill 60 Sector, the change was a very popular one.</p>

<p>Ottawa Camp now came within the area of another Division,
and the Civil Service Rifles, on being relieved on the 12th of
April by the First Surrey Rifles, moved into Divisional Reserve
in Devonshire Camp, near Busseboom.</p>

<p>Early in April rumours of a big Spring offensive began to
relieve the monotony, and the story was passed from one to
another in strict confidence that the Civil Service Rifles would
soon attack a ch&acirc;teau in a wood just south of the canal, where
the Adjutant was of opinion that “we shall have some interesting
wood fighting.”</p>

<p>The next trip to the front line was to the Spoil Bank section
itself, whence rumour had it that the attack would some day
be launched, and amateur tacticians were thus able to study
the scheme on the spot. A preliminary reconnaissance
generally ended in the observer hoping he would be away on
leave or on a course when the attack should eventually take
place.</p>

<p>An unsuccessful attempt at a raid by the enemy at 4.30 a.m.
on the 25th April was the only incident of note in a somewhat
uninteresting stay in the front line, where nearly every trench
appeared to be open to direct observation from the Bosche. The
mystery about the Spoil Bank sector, with its trenches so open
and devoid of shelter, was that in five days there were only
eight casualties, all of which occurred during the enemy’s
attempted raid. The bombardment during the raid was such
as to make every man look forward with more than usual keenness
to the relief on the following night by the 6th Battalion,
when the Civil Service Rifles moved to Dominion Camp, adjoining
Devonshire Camp.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />

<span class="medium">THE MORINGHEM TREK</span></h2>

<p>A long stay of eleven days in Dominion Lines ended with a
return to the Support positions around Swan Ch&acirc;teau on the
8th of May, but only three days were spent here (during which
time there were thirteen casualties, an unusually high number
for the comparative safety of support positions) before the
Battalion was relieved by the Poplar and Stepneys, and moved
back to the village of Dickebusch for two days, before starting
on the “Moringhem Trek,” the first affair of its kind since the
memorable trek to the Somme.</p>

<p>The trek began on the 13th of May with a march to the
village of Watou, and the old soldier now knew that he would
soon be taking part in an attack. “They’re not taking us all
this way for exercise, or simply for our amusement” he told the
latest joined recruit as they marched along, “but it’s worth it to
get away from the Salient for a few days and to see the civvies
once more without any fear of shelling. And remember, when we
go over the odds are generally about four to one on a blighty,
so don’t worry.”</p>

<p>The billets were good in Watou, but they were even better in
the village of Sercus, where the Battalion, after marching
through Hazebrouck, spent the second night. General regret
was felt that only one night was spent in this village, and on the
third day, after passing through Arques and St. Omer, the
training area was reached and the Companies were billeted in
the village of Moringhem and the neighbouring villages. On
the whole the billets were poor and uncomfortable, besides
being scattered. “A” and Headquarters Company were in
Moringhem itself, “B” and “C” were about a mile and a half
away in Petit Difques, and “D” were in the little hamlet of
Cuslinghem.</p>

<p>It was announced that about three weeks would be spent
in this district, and a somewhat ambitious programme of sports
and recreation was drawn up. The training was often finished
soon after mid-day. An inter-platoon football competition
was started, and preliminary heats for the Battalion Sports
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
Meeting, to be held on the 20th of May, were run off during
the early days of the “holiday.”</p>

<p>The Brigadier having expressed a wish that officers and men
should be given facilities to visit St. Omer, parties were made
up each day for that purpose. The men generally went in
G.S. wagons and limbers, and the officers usually returned
<i>a voiture</i>.</p>

<p>A novelty in Regimental Sports was introduced on the 19th
of May at what was reported in the <i>Financial Times</i> as the
Moringhem May Meeting, when the only event was a horse
race for officers’ chargers.</p>

<p>The race took place after church parade, and was over a
five furlong course behind the village church. Unfortunately,
one or two of the starters were not quite sure where the course
was, and consequently several horses had to wait at “the
tapes” while Battalion orderlies scoured the village for missing
runners and jockeys. More unfortunate still was the experience
of the “bookie” who, at great trouble, had secured costumes
for himself and his clerk, but who spent the morning wandering
about the neighbouring hills, vainly searching for the course,
and cursing his clerk for a fool.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Craig, the Transport Officer, acted as starter to a
field of seven. The Adjutant’s horse, Bunty, was first away, but
his jockey lost a stirrup and could not keep the lead. Entering
the straight, the Medical Officer (Captain C. M. Gozney) on the Boy,
was in front, and, shaking off the challenge by Bunty and Sunshine,
he rode a good race and won by a short head from the
former, with Sunshine (ridden by Captain F. D. Balfour) close
up third. The winner started at 5-2, Bunty at 3-1, and Sunshine
at 100-3. The favourite Polly (5-4), ridden by Captain Bowers
Taylor, a heavyweight jockey, was quite unable to give the
weight away to the leaders. The bookie, it should be mentioned,
arrived on the course just in time to “pay out,” as there had
been considerable ante-post betting, and all the placed horses
had been well backed.</p>

<p>The Battalion Sports Meeting on the following day was
marred by orders to send off a digging party of 200 other ranks
to dig trenches on the training ground. The whole Battalion
had turned up on the Transport Field, and cookers were in
attendance so that tea could be had on the ground, but after
the departure of the working party, interest in the Sports died
down, and the crowd, somewhat disappointed, filtered away.</p>

<p>Much keener interest was taken in the Inter-platoon football
competition, in the final of which Numbers 5 and 15 Platoons
met three times at Moringhem without being able to come to
a decision. Two hours exciting play on each of the first two
occasions failed to produce even a goal, but at the third meeting,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
play actually continued until Lights Out, when the score was
two goals all. It should, perhaps, be mentioned that in these
days of summer time it was not uncommon for Lights Out to
be sounded while it was still daylight. The football final was
not decided until after the Battalion had been in the front line.
The score on that occasion, when Number 15 Platoon won by
no less than nine goals to nothing, was an eloquent but sad
testimony to what had happened since the three drawn games
at Moringhem.</p>

<p>The stay at Moringhem differed in many respects from the
preparation for the Somme battle in 1916. On this occasion
the Division marched straight to its training ground, which
was reached in three days. The marked out course quickly
made its appearance, and it was made known at the outset
that the 140th Brigade was training for the attack on the German
positions around the White Ch&acirc;teau, just south of the Canal,
near Hollebeke. Moreover, the “non-starters” were selected
at the beginning of the training, and the rehearsals were carried
out with the officers, N.C.O.’s and men who were going to take
part in the actual attack.</p>

<p>The training was nothing like so strenuous as that for the
High Wood battle, and the men thus finished their day’s work
with sufficient energy left for football and other sports in the
evening. In one respect the experience of the Somme preparation
was repeated. The Adjutant, Captain W. E. Ind, M.C.,
threw himself whole heartedly and enthusiastically into the
work of training the Battalion and had very quickly mastered
every detail of the scheme. It was very largely due to his efforts
that the Civil Service Rifles left Moringhem thoroughly prepared
for their share in the battle and so full of confidence in their
success.</p>

<p>On the whole a very happy time had been spent at Moringhem,
and there was no great anxiety to leave the place on the 31st
of May, when the Battalion returned by train from St. Omer
to Poperinghe, where, as they marched out of the station, the
troops were greeted at once with a few shells&mdash;just as a reminder
that they were back in the Salient.</p>

<p>The discomforts of the Ypres Salient were rarely more forcibly
illustrated than on the afternoon of the arrival at the so-called
tented camp in Dominion Lines. The march from Poperinghe
Station took place in the afternoon, and the Battalion marched
into Dominion Lines with visions of a comfortable camp and
a welcome cup of tea! The men were doomed to disappointment,
for the “camp” proved to be a strip of waste ground,
very dusty, and without even a blade of grass on it. There
were a few bivouac sheets to be issued to each Company, and
there were about three bell tents for officers. Beyond this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
there was not a stick of camp equipment of any kind. The
disappointment was all the keener because the Area Commandant
was a Civil Service Rifles officer, and it was thought he might
have treated his own Regiment a little better. The other three
Battalions of the Brigade were comfortably housed in huts.</p>

<p>The country all around presented a very different aspect
from that seen in the autumn of 1916, when the Division came
to Ypres for a rest. On all sides one now saw signs of the coming
offensive. The roads were lined with big ammunition dumps,
a few of which were blown up nightly by Bosche artillery fire,
which had increased very considerably during the past month.
The English artillery, too, had increased their activity, and
some wonderful bombardments were witnessed both by day
and night. The Bosche, in fact, could not have had much
doubt of what was in store for him. The only doubt in his
mind would be how much longer he would be allowed to remain
in his front line trenches.</p>

<p>A mysterious-looking enclosure, marked “Segregated Area,”
attracted a good deal of attention from the curious among the
troops, who, after reading the notice outside, that no horses
could be admitted, discovered that many tanks were housed
there. Members of the Civil Service Rifles who had been on the
Somme heaved a sigh of relief when they learnt that, although
tanks were co-operating in the coming attack, none were allotted
a definite part in the task of their Battalion.</p>

<p>The 2nd of June was devoted to final preparations for the
battle. Officers got their men together for a little extra talk,
and all ranks eagerly studied maps and aeroplane photographs,
of which there was a generous supply and which showed clearly
how thoroughly the artillery had prepared the way. There
was an atmosphere of suppressed excitement similar to that of
the days before High Wood, but on this occasion there was
greater confidence, inspired by the unmistakable evidence
on all sides of the magnificent work of the artillery and the
Air Force.</p>

<p>Company Commanders went up to reconnoitre the support
positions which the Battalion was to occupy the next day,
and working parties were sent out along the cross-country
tracks, which had been made to ease the traffic along the roads.
These parties were occupied all day in the pleasant task of
filling up the shell holes which the Bosche had made overnight.</p>

<p>The battle surplus to be left behind when an Infantry Battalion
took part in an attack had by this time been clearly defined
by General Headquarters, and consequently a large party of
“non-starters” joined the Divisional Reinforcement Camp
before the Battalion left for the trenches on the 3rd of June.
These included, in addition to two of the regular Company
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
Commanders, representatives of every platoon and specialist
section in the Battalion-picked N.C.O.’s and men who would
form a worthy nucleus on which to build a new Battalion in
the event of heavy casualties being suffered. The Divisional
Reinforcement Camp was commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Warrender,
who had left the Civil Service Rifles the previous November
to command the 47th Divisional School at Poperinghe.

<span class="medium">MESSINES&mdash;7TH JUNE, 1917</span></h2>

<p>The Regimental Diary gives a detailed description of the career
of the Civil Service Rifles from the time of leaving Dominion
Lines on the night of the 3rd of June to the return from the
trenches after the battle:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Just before we started for the trenches at 10.0 p.m., the Bosche
dropped a few big shells on the track near the segregated area, so it
was felt that as we had to pass this point the war had started in
earnest. Fortunately the whole Battalion passed this area without
mishap, and the journey to the trenches was very quiet until we
approached Caf&eacute; Belge, when we received a message that the Bosche
was shelling that spot freely with gas shells. The information
proved to be true, and the Battalion had its first experience of a real
gas shell bombardment&mdash;happily without any casualties. We
reached the support positions&mdash;trenches in the vicinity of Swan
Ch&acirc;teau and Ch&acirc;teau Segard&mdash;without any further adventure, and
after relieving the Poplar and Stepney Rifles, spent a quiet night in
very crowded quarters.</p>

<p>“The Battalion spent three days in these trenches, and on the
whole they were very pleasant. The weather was good, and there
were practically no working parties, so the men got plenty of time
for rest. The time was spent in such final preparation for the attack
as issuing bombs, rifle grenades, ground flares, picks, shovels and
chewing gum (one stick between two) and rations for ‘the day.’
The Company Commanders reconnoitred the assembly positions on
the morning of the 6th, and by that afternoon everything was ready
for the move up to the assembly trenches. The whole Battalion was
in excellent spirit and every one was full of confidence. The men
had taken a very keen interest in the orders and every man knew the
part he had to play.</p>

<p>“We had a quiet move to the assembly trenches at night, and
although the tracks and back areas were receiving their usual
nightly ration of shells, there were no casualties.</p>

<p>“It was now known that the attack would be delivered at dawn,
and the few hours before zero were spent in comparative peace.
The trenches were those occupied by the Civil Service Rifles on
their last visit to the front line. ‘A’ Company was in the old Lock
House, near the Spoil Bank by the side of the Canal. The remaining
Companies were on their right in West Terrace and Grenade Trench,
in the order in which they were to attack. ‘D’ was on the right,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
‘B’ next, ‘C’ next, and for the attack ‘A’ Company came out of
the Lock House and formed the left flank.</p>

<p>“Zero for the great 2nd Army attack was at 3.10 a.m. on the
7th of June, but our Battalion took no part in the first phase. An
hour before zero, all Company Commanders were to report to
Battalion Headquarters to be on the spot if anything went wrong
with the first phase. Battalion Headquarters was in a smelly, wet
dug-out in West Terrace. It had walls of brick and some attempt
at a concrete roof. The party assembled there consisted of the
Commanding Officer, Lieutenant-Colonel H. Marshall (Hampshire
Regiment), the Adjutant, Captain W. E. Ind, M.C., and the four
Company Commanders&mdash;‘A’ Company, Captain A. Bowers Taylor
(Manchester Regiment, attached); ‘B’ Company, Captain G. C.
Grimsdale; ‘C’ Company, Second-Lieutenant P. Davenport; and
‘D’ Company, Second-Lieutenant G. Hasleham (Manchester
Regiment, attached). The Signals Officer, Second-Lieutenant R. W.
Illing and the Bombing Officer, Second-Lieutenant O. E. Burden,
also hovered about, and there was the usual ‘chorus’ generally
found hanging round Battalion Headquarters&mdash;servants, police,
pioneers, signallers and runners. Wallis, the ‘head waiter,’ moved
about as unconcerned as ever, with sandwiches and whisky and
soda for the guests. The gathering reminded one of Bairnsfather’s
sketch, ‘An hour before going into trenches.’ Ind tried hard to
keep the conversation going; Grimsdale, who occupied one of the
few seats, appeared somewhat subdued, though he had a few knotty
problems to put to the assembly. Hasleham, who squatted tailor
fashion on the floor, went to sleep, while Bowers Taylor and Davenport
spent the time trying to follow his example&mdash;without much success.</p>

<p>“At 3.10 a.m. precisely, the floor, walls and ceiling began to rock
furiously, and we realised that the Australian tunnellers in Marshall
Walk had not boasted idly when they told us last November that
their mine under Hill 60 would one day stagger humanity. A
moment later, another big mine went up at St. Eloi, and at the same
time the most wonderful bombardment there has ever been known
was let loose. Big guns, howitzers and field guns seemed to be
firing from everywhere behind us, and one could not help feeling
overawed by the magnificence of our artillery. The machine guns
joined in the fun, and the whole thing inspired every one with great
confidence. No human beings could possibly withstand such a
bombardment. It was the noise of the bombardment, so often
described as drumfire, which was mistaken afar off for the noise of
the mines, and imaginative journalists with a keen sense of hearing
afterwards wrote tales of how they had heard the mines in London.
The mines actually made comparatively little noise.</p>

<p>“We had three hours to wait before our time came to jump off,
so we tried to see what was going on in front, where the 7th and 8th
Battalions were attacking the White Ch&acirc;teau and neighbouring
trenches. Little could be seen, however, beyond a big cloud of dust
and here and there a tank toiling over the shell holes. The Bosche,
apparently, had no guns to spare for us, as he left us entirely alone,
and at 5.15 a.m. we moved up to our jumping off trenches
undisturbed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span></p>

<p>“The Adjutant, who for many weeks had worked on this scheme
harder than the producer of plays ever worked on a great masterpiece,
came up to see us off, and as the situation was so quiet we were able
to form up in waves outside our jumping-off trenches. Our new
padr&eacute;, too, came along to wish the ‘dear lads’ the best of luck, and
to distribute a large quantity of cigarettes. A staunch friend to the
troops at all times, the Rev. Ernest Beattie was surely the most
cheery padr&eacute; a Battalion could have had. It did one good to see
his genial smile whenever he came round the line.</p>

<p>“The first wave consisted of one platoon of each Company, ‘A’
on the left under Sergeant Steele, then ‘C’ (Second-Lieutenant
Stoneman), ‘B’ (Sergeant G. T. Bachell), and ‘D’ (Second-Lieutenant
G. T. Mellett). An additional platoon of ‘B’ under
Second-Lieutenant Temple was attached to this wave which, under
the command of the Officer Commanding ‘C’ Company, moved off
at 6.25 a.m. The Battalion scouts, who had previously gone forward
to reconnoitre, had just returned and reported that all had gone well
with the Post Office Rifles, who were holding all their objectives,
and that the stream beyond, which we had to cross, was practically
dry and offered no obstacle.</p>

<p>“The first wave had a good start, and in a line of sections in single
file went unhindered through the three objectives held by the Post
Office Rifles and across the aforesaid stream in the White Ch&acirc;teau
grounds, until it opened out to two lines in extended order and
halted under the barrage in a hollow in front of the first objective,
Oak Crescent, a trench just south of the White Ch&acirc;teau stables.
The first wave of the 6th Battalion, who were attacking the stables
on our left, moved off at the same time. While waiting for the
barrage to lift, we suffered a few casualties.</p>

<p>“The scene in the hollow while waiting for the barrage to lift was
a truly remarkable one. The inevitable mixing up of waves had
occurred, and the 2nd, 3rd and 4th waves, who were following
the first at five minute intervals, here became merged into one mass,
and the scene looked like the field for a big cross-country race. The
mix-up had occurred owing to the men crossing the rough ground
much more quickly than had been expected. In the background a
tank was slowly making its way across the line of our advance to
assist the 6th Battalion at the stables if necessary. A small crowd
gathered round it and watched it with interest. What was most
extraordinary was the very slight enemy fire, and men were able to
sort themselves out more or less with ease.</p>

<p>“When the barrage lifted, the first wave went forward to assault
Oak Crescent, but the difficulty was not so much to capture it as
to recognise it, for our guns had done their work so well that it was
hard to find the place where the trench had been&mdash;and there was no
trace of a Bosche either alive or dead. The second wave, consisting
of one platoon of ‘C’ Company under Sergeant Glass, and one
platoon of ‘D’ Company with Company Headquarters, arrived to
‘mop up’ the trench, but as they could not find any trench to
mop up, they devoted their time to trying to dig one instead. About
this time the Officer Commanding ‘A’ Company, Captain A. Bowers
Taylor, was killed, and the Officer Commanding ‘D’ Company,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
Second-Lieutenant Hasleham, was wounded, and in addition the
Battalion suffered its most serious loss since leaving England.
Lieutenant Ind, who, in his eagerness to see that everything went
well, had followed the Battalion up to the hollow ground before
the first objective, was hit in the head by a piece of shell, and,
although he was taken down immediately, he was so badly wounded
that he died the same evening without recovering consciousness in
No. 10 Casualty Clearing Station, near Poperinghe. So the Civil
Service Rifles lost the finest Territorial soldier who ever served with
them. Fortunately the news did not get round for some time, but
it had a somewhat depressing effect when it became known, for
needless to say, Lieutenant Ind was loved by every officer, N.C.O.
and man in the Battalion. No man could have worked harder
for the welfare of a Battalion than he did, nor could anyone be more
fearless and unselfish than he was. He had been with the 1st
Civil Service Rifles continuously since the Foreign Service Battalion
was formed, and throughout he had devoted himself wholeheartedly
to the Regiment, whose members he was ever ready to help in any
way he possibly could. He was a magnificent soldier, a thorough
gentleman, and an ideal friend, and his loss has left a gap in the
Battalion which can never be adequately filled. He had been looked
upon for so long as so essential a part of the Battalion that his many
friends found it difficult to realise that he had been killed.</p>

</div>

<p>“By a strange coincidence, Lieutenant-Colonel H. H. Kemble, M.C.,
the Commanding Officer of the 23rd London Regiment (who, as
Captain Kemble, had been Ind’s Company Commander in the Civil
Service Rifles during their first six months in France) was mortally
wounded almost at the same time as his old friend, and died the same
night in the same ward. These two old comrades were buried side
by side in the Military Cemetery just south of Poperinghe between
the railway and the road to Westoutre.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant-Colonel Kemble’s death was lamented by all who
knew him in the Civil Service Rifles, where he was so well known
and respected as a very gallant Company Commander.</p>

<p>“But although, as has been stated, the loss of Lieutenant Ind
had a somewhat depressing effect, it did not interfere with the attack,
and the third wave, consisting of one platoon of ‘A’ Company
(Second-Lieutenant G. W. Ackworth), one of ‘C’ Company (Second-Lieutenant
T. Woods), one of ‘B’ (Second-Lieutenant Samuel)
and one of ‘D’ (Second-Lieutenant Margrett), under the Officer
Commanding ‘B’ Company, moved through the line of what was
once Oak Crescent, and took their objective, Oblong Trench, with
little opposition.</p>

<p>“The fourth wave, also consisting of a platoon from each Company
(‘A,’ Second-Lieutenant L. C. Morris, ‘B,’ Second-Lieutenant
C. Stevenson, ‘C,’ Second-Lieutenant C. V. Marchant, and ‘D,’
Second-Lieutenant Moran), now moved through Oak Crescent and
amalgamated with the first wave. The two together then moved
forward, with an additional platoon of ‘A’ Company (Second-Lieutenant
A. Wilson) on the left, and captured the final objective,
Oblong Reserve, where a few tired and frightened Germans readily
gave themselves up.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

<p>“About 200 yards beyond the final objective was a ruined building,
known as Delbske Farm, surrounded by a trench. The instructions
were that a patrol was to be pushed out to the farm, which, if
not held strongly, was to be rushed and captured. A kind of
scramble was accordingly made for the farm by a party consisting
of ‘C’ Company Headquarters, and Nos. 9 and 11 Platoons, with
Sergeant Steele’s platoon of ‘A’ Company and any odd men of
other Companies who happened to be handy. The farm and trench
were taken with little opposition, and about thirty prisoners came
pouring out of the building anxious to be shown the way ‘home.’</p>

<p>“In every case throughout the day the objective had been
captured with ease. There were very few Bosches to be found, and
these immediately gave themselves up without a struggle when we
entered their trenches. Indeed, the only infantry action took place
after the trench at Delbske Farm had been taken, when patrols,
going out to right and left, were subject to rifle fire from Bosche
patrols, who later in the morning seemed to have recovered from
their fright sufficiently to inflict a few casualties on the occupants of
the trench outside the farm. It was here that Sergeant Steele and
Corporal Freeman, of ‘A’ Company, after doing sterling work on
patrol, were shot through the head and killed instantly.</p>

<p>“Late in the afternoon the Bosche began shelling heavily, but
although our aeroplanes twice reported him to be massing for counter-attack,
he was effectively dispersed by our artillery and did not
even leave his trenches.</p>

<p>“The night was fairly quiet except for some desultory shelling;
but the troops were all very tired after their efforts of the past 24
hours, and it came as a very pleasant surprise when early on the
morning of the 8th, the 2nd Leinsters arrived and relieved us. The
four Companies moved back to Ecluse Trench&mdash;a support trench
running south from the canal about half a mile behind our original
assembly positions. It was quite a comfortable place and the
weather was fine and warm. The tired troops were therefore able
to enjoy a solid day’s sleep, undisturbed by shells. They were all
very proud of their victory, and when they were not sleeping they
were all talking at once, comparing souvenirs and recounting their
various experiences.”</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So ended the first phase of the capture of the Messines-Wytschaete
Ridge. It had been a wonderful demonstration
of the power of artillery supported by a thorough aeroplane
reconnaissance. From the point of view of the infantry it had
been a “walk over,” at least so far as the Civil Service Rifles
were concerned. Tales were told of hand-to-hand struggles
in the vicinity of the White Ch&acirc;teau, but the German troops
opposed to the Civil Service Rifles evidently knew whom they
had to deal with and they wisely refrained from indulging in
any fighting. The casualties, happily, were few, and the
victory, considering the number of objectives and the extent
of ground covered, was undoubtedly a cheap one. It was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
illustrated very clearly, however, how impossible it is, when
advancing over a wide area of rough ground, to arrive at the
distant objective in anything like the waves laid down in the
training pamphlets.</p>

<p>Here were conditions ideal for a model attack&mdash;excellent
artillery support, well-trained men, every one of whom was
keen and clearly understood the scheme which had been so
thoroughly rehearsed, and a very weak opposition, and yet
the attack became little more than a scramble after the first
objective was passed. At the same time the troops had taken
and held all the objectives allotted to them, and there was a
feeling of satisfaction among the members of the Civil Service
Rifles that the Battalion had done all that it was asked to do
in what was, so far, the greatest British victory of the war.</p>

<p>After two days’ rest in Ecluse Trench a return was made to
the front line, and the 6th Battalion were relieved on the 10th
of June in a trench known as Opal Reserve&mdash;on the left of
Oblong Reserve, familiar to the Civil Service Rifles as one of
their objectives on the 7th. Battalion Headquarters was in
what was left of the White Ch&acirc;teau itself.</p>

<p>Although only two days were spent here it was a much more
trying experience than the battle had been, and the casualties
suffered were considerably more than the average for merely
holding the line. The Bosche had now reorganised his artillery,
and he was using it to some purpose on the White Ch&acirc;teau
and its grounds. The first taste of the trouble was given to
No. 9 platoon of “C” Company on their way to the front line.
Starting out with about twenty men under Second Lieutenant
Stoneman, only nine reached the front line in Opal Reserve,
four having been killed, and seven wounded.</p>

<p>The front line trench, which was mostly mud, was held by
“B” and “C” Companies, “A” and “D” being in reserve
in a series of German “pill box” shelters. Second Lieutenant
L. L. Burtt was now in command of “B” Company, and it is
said he spent the time in being pulled out of the mud by his
Sergeant-Major (R. H. Burden), and in turn pulling him out.
There was no shelter of any kind for either of the front line
Companies, but “C” Company Headquarters occupied a niche
cut out of the wall of the trench, and there the Company Commander
sat with an officer on each side of him, like statues in
the walls of a cathedral.</p>

<p>The time here was spent in clearing the trench of the ever-falling
debris, dodging shells, and digging a jumping-off trench
for the 41st Division, who were shortly to continue the advance.
For this purpose they relieved the 47th Division on the night
of the 12th of June, and the Civil Service Rifles gladly handed
over their strip of mud to the 18th Battalion K.R.R., and made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
their way out to Chippewa Camp, near Reninghelst, where they
arrived at about 6.0 a.m. on the 13th of June, so tired that
they didn’t care a fig who held the Messines-Wytschaete Ridge.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In accordance with the usual practice after a big battle,
the Division went right back for rest and reorganisation, and
after two days’ marching the Civil Service Rifles, on the 16th
of June, reached the village of Ebblinghem, between Hazebrouck
and St. Omer.</p>

<p>The twelve days spent in this village were chiefly devoted
to preparing for an inspection by the Divisional Commander,
and training for the Divisional Water Carnival at Blaringhem.
An al fresco concert in “D” Company’s billet on the 23rd of
June threatened to fall flat, but the arrival, at a gallop, of a
limber with a large barrel of beer on board set things moving,
and the concert finished very well.</p>

<p>The Divisional Water Carnival was held in the canal at
Blaringhem on the 26th, and the crowd of visitors made one
think of a Town Regatta on the Thames, the fair sex being well
represented. The weather was gloriously fine, and the comic
events were well to the fore in the programme. The Battalion
carried off its fair share of the honours, the chief success being
that of the R.Q.M.S., W. B. Hart, who built the winning boat
in the odd craft race, cleverly rowed by R. D. Tidmarsh, who
won an easy victory by a distance. A small lottery was arranged
for the visitors, and Mdlle. Victoria, the fair damsel at the
Civil Service Rifles Headquarters billet, won the first prize.
This brought to a close the holiday at Ebblinghem, for the
march back to the war was begun on the morning of the 28th, and,
after staying one night at Meteren and one night at Voormezeele,
the month of July found the Civil Service Rifles in support
in what had been the German front line immediately south of
the Canal.</p>

<p>The weather was bad, the trenches were in a perfectly rotten
state of repair, and the men had no protection against persistent
shelling. Three very unlucky days were spent here, during
which time the losses from shell fire amounted to about forty
all ranks, and on the night of the 3rd of July, after being relieved
by Companies from the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd Battalions, a weary
and somewhat fed up Battalion made its way to Murrumbidgee
Camp&mdash;a hutted camp near the village of La Clytte.</p>

<p>The chief attraction here was a bathing pond which, although
somewhat “soupy,” was well patronised by the troops.</p>

<span class="medium">THE RENAISSANCE</span></h2>

<p>Among the prominent events which may be regarded as landmarks
or milestones in the career of the Civil Service Rifles
in France, two have already been passed&mdash;Vimy Ridge and
High Wood. The third milestone was one of a different
character, but the arrival of Lieut.-Colonel F. W. Parish, M.C.,
to take command most certainly marked the beginning of a
new phase in the life of the Battalion. As the pre-war Adjutant,
Captain Parish had played a great part in the training of the
Civil Service Rifles for war, and all who knew him at the time
will remember his keenness. He left the Battalion at the end
of October, 1915, to be G.S.O. III of the 19th Division, and
afterwards took command of one of the Service Battalions of
the North Staffords, with whom he was severely wounded in
the Somme Battle of 1916.</p>

<p>It was soon found that he had lost none of his enthusiasm
for the Civil Service Rifles, and although a great many changes
had taken place since he left, there were still a good many who
remembered him, and as he walked along the trenches in Bois
Confluent, near St. Eloi, on the 9th of July, he could not mistake
the welcome that was shown to him in the faces of all his old
friends. The Battalion, sad to relate, had become somewhat
stale and had a tired look, and the new Commanding Officer
supplied just the touch of renewed vigour which had been
lacking of late. He took the earliest opportunity to tell the
troops that he was glad to see them all, but that they were not
quite the Battalion of old, and he would not be content until
they were. He said they were not as clean as they might be,
and although they had fought well, they were not so smart,
and their discipline was not so good as it should be. All these
things, he said, must be put right, and, as there was no time
like the present, he put his preaching into practice right away
in the support positions in Bois Confluent.</p>

<p>There followed such a craze for cleaning up clothing and
equipment as had not been known for many months, and all
ranks entered into the new spirit with enthusiasm. Ten rough
days in front line trenches around the gates of the White Ch&acirc;teau
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
grounds on the Hollebeke Road, where the Germans shelled
all day and every day, and where one side or the other carried
out a raid nearly every night, ended in the Battalion being
relieved on the night of the 24th of June by the 18th King’s
Royal Rifles, and moving to Carnarvon Camp, near Westoutre,
one of the most uncomfortable camps occupied by the Civil
Service Rifles during the war.</p>

<p>After one day’s rest the work of “restoration” was resumed,
and vigorous “spit and polish” was indulged in for three days
before the Commanding Officer inspected the Battalion. In a
breezy speech he said he could already see a distinct improvement,
and he felt sure a further improvement would follow.</p>

<p>On the 30th of July the Civil Service Rifles became the envied
of all the other units in the Division as they marched to
Wippenhoek Siding near Abeele, and entrained for St. Omer,
whence a short march brought them to Tatinghem. Here the
Battalion was to carry out a training programme, consisting
chiefly of musketry on the 2nd Army ranges near Moulle.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In his work of revival, there is no doubt that Colonel Parish
had everything in his favour. In the first place he had sole
command of the unit and was not worried by any orders from
either Brigade or Division. The training was to be done entirely
under the Commanding Officer’s own arrangements, the only
condition laid down being that every one must have musketry
practice on the range. In the second place the Battalion was
sent to a pleasantly situated training area many miles from
the firing line, and thirdly the billets were excellent&mdash;in many
cases better than the men had ever had before in France. Practically
every sergeant, at least, had a real bed in an inhabited
house.</p>

<p>In these circumstances it would have been strange indeed
if all ranks had not responded wholeheartedly to the call of
their Commanding Officer, whose enthusiasm quickly spread
throughout the Battalion. It is true the “spit and polish”
days of General Cuthbert were put into the shade by the scrubbing
and polishing which were indulged in from morning till
night in the early days at Tatinghem, and all the time-honoured
jokes and gags about Bluebell Metal Polish, Kiwi, etc., were
literally worked to death. Men groused and joked alternately
about the new craze, and one wag chalked up on a billet door
a colourable imitation of the Regimental crest, beneath which
he had substituted the words “Ich Posh” for the actual motto.
Thanks to the inclement weather, there was no chance during
the first few days to do anything but remain in billets and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
“clean up,” and when eventually the rain ceased and Colonel
Parish saw his Battalion on parade, he was so proud of the men
that he spent a good deal of his spare time thereafter in persuading
General Officers and others to come and inspect them.
The Civil Service Rifles, in consequence, underwent inspections
during this holiday by General Plumer (twice), Brigadier-General
Kennedy, and Brigadier-General Bailey, in addition to numerous
inspections by the Commanding Officer. The men endured
these ordeals with little or no grousing&mdash;for they had now learnt
to take a proper pride in their smart appearance.</p>

<p>The Commanding Officer’s chief worry was lack of a parade
ground where he could drill his battalion, and the Adjutant
was ordered to find one. It was in vain that he said the local
farmers objected to their pasture being ruined by the tramping
of army boots, so eventually he discovered a field without a
gate to it, and hoped the farmer would not turn up during
battalion drill. The farmer did not appear himself, but his
wife came on parade and protested so loudly to the Adjutant
that the Commanding Officer exclaimed in a loud voice “Send
that woman off parade. This is not a woman’s battalion.”
This brilliant sally, however, was wasted on the woman, who
continued to protest volubly&mdash;and those who have heard a
French peasant woman when she is roused will realise how difficult
it was to induce her to leave the field.</p>

<p>The great day of the training was the Regimental Rifle Meeting,
run almost on Bisley lines, which was held on the ranges at
Moulle, on the 6th of August. Prizes were offered for the best
sergeant and the best corporal in the Battalion, for the best
private in each Company, and for each member of the Platoon
having the highest average. In addition, all prize winners
were to have a day’s leave.</p>

<p>The Prize Meeting was a great success, and the keenest interest
was taken in the competitions, on which there were various
sweepstakes, while, in addition, two members of the Battalion
“made a book” on one of the competitions, their most profitable
dupe being the Commanding Officer himself.</p>

<p>“C” Company appear to have swept the board as far as
Platoon averages went, as two of their Platoons took the first
two places, and one other tied with numbers eight (“B”
Company) and thirteen (“D” Company) for third place. The
following received silver wrist watches suitably engraved for
the occasion:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Officers’ competition was won by Second-Lieutenant G. E.
Tatum, ‘C’ Company.</p></blockquote>

<p>Shortly after the Rifle Meeting the Battalion became attached
to the 142nd Brigade, and this caused a move to Moringhem,
but after two General Officers’ inspections in four days the
Civil Service Rifles, to their great joy, returned to their old
billets, the 140th Brigade having been sent to the Tatinghem
area for training.</p>

<p>The puzzle so far had been the absence of the marked-out
or “flagged” course, and speculation was rife as to how soon
the familiar signs would appear on the training ground, but
beyond practising an advance (through fields of cut corn) in
what the Commanding Officer called lines of “worms,” no
very warlike movements were undertaken, nor was there any
mention of a coming operation. So the holiday at Tatinghem
came to an end without any rehearsing of a set piece which
had been such a conspicuous feature of former holidays of this
kind.</p>

<p>Just before leaving Tatinghem, a mild interest was taken
in the appearance on parade of a second Colonel, wearing the
uniform of a Scottish regiment, who inspected the Battalion
on the 23rd of August, and thereafter did not miss a parade.
There were numerous speculations as to who was this unassuming-looking
fellow in the Scotch cap, and what did he want, but
no one guessed what a great part he was soon to play in the
history of the Regiment.</p>

<p>A seemingly endless column of motor buses and lorries took
the 140th Brigade back to the war on the 24th of August, and
the Civil Service Rifles occupied Vancouver Camp, which seemed
dreadfully uncomfortable after the luxury of Tatinghem. The
accommodation was poor, and the day was cold with a biting
wind howling and blowing the dust over everything. The
troops experienced very much the same kind of feeling as on
return to a City office after a month at the seaside or in the
country, and before turning in for the night a rumour went
round that the Division would very soon attack Polygon and
Glencorse Woods, beyond Westhoek Ridge. Pleasant dreams!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br />

<span class="medium">LAST DAYS IN THE YPRES SALIENT</span></h2>

<p>As a sequel to overnight rumours, all officers were taken the
next day to study a ground plan of the country from Passchendaele
to Westhoek Ridge&mdash;an excellent model of what had now become
the most famous battlefield on the western front. The
parts which specially interested the Civil Service Rifles were
the wood known as Nonne Boschen and Glencorse Wood. In
the afternoon the N.C.O.’s were taken to see the model, and it
was explained to them that they were soon to attack the positions
in the two woods mentioned. These had been captured
more than once during the past week or two, but in each case
the captors had been pushed back by a German counter-attack.</p>

<p>The next step followed at a very early hour the morning
after, when a party of officers boarded a bus outside camp,
and long before daylight were deposited outside the Asylum
at Ypres. Crossing the now world-famous city, they passed
out at the Menin Gate and down the dreaded Menin Road to
Hooge, whence they made a general reconnaissance of the country
from Bellewarde Ridge over Westhoek Ridge. The situation
in the front line seemed a trifle obscure, and those holding it
did not altogether cheer their visitors up when discussing the
proposed attack. It certainly surprised the said visitors to
learn that one group of old gun pits, where they were supposed
to assemble for their attack, was being held by the Bosches.
This news, however, did not have any serious effect on the
scheme, and the following day a party of N.C.O.’s accompanied
the Adjutant on a similar reconnaissance. Rain poured in
torrents from start to finish, and it is feared that the party,
absolutely wet through to the skin, did not display very great
enthusiasm for their work that day.</p>

<p>There followed a lecture by the Commanding Officer in the
Vancouver Theatre on the coming attack. The Army School
lecturer of these days still laboured under the delusion that
the assaulting infantry in an attack arrived at the objective
in waves, in spite of ditches, water jumps, barbed wire or other
obstacles. To hear him talk of the attack it all seemed so easy,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
that one could only wonder why it had not been done before&mdash;preferably
by the staff of an Army School.</p>

<p>Colonel Parish, who had been an instructor at the Senior
Officers’ School at Aldershot earlier in the year, contrived to instil
his optimism into the troops, who entered on the flagged course
rehearsals the next day with considerable enthusiasm. Even
the two men of “C” Company who were detailed to wade
through a marsh, said to exist in No Man’s Land, were heard
to joke about their “chances.”</p>

<p>Consequently the troops, although not generally bellicose,
were almost eager for the fray, as there was a distinct feeling
among them that something big should be done to justify the
recent holiday. Thus it came about that members of the
Battalion were heard to say that they were looking forward to
the battle. This attitude was certainly a novelty, for although
there was never a lack of volunteers for any enterprise, however
dangerous, nor was there ever any disposition to “swing it”
before a battle, it had for a long time been the practice to look
askance at any man who claimed to be keen on a fight. The
recognised attitude in public circles, both on the part of officers
and other ranks, was that of a pacifist. “Live and let live”
was claimed as their motto by some of the most zealous soldiers,
simply because they hated the idea of being dubbed “fire-eaters,”
and often a most gallant fighter would be one who
asserted loudly that he was always very “windy,” to use popular
parlance, or that there was nothing he dreaded more than going
over the top. However, on the occasion referred to, officers
and men were more honest, and most, if not all, readily asserted
their keenness for the difficult and somewhat complicated
form of attack which they were soon to undertake in the neighbourhood
of Westhoek Ridge.</p>

<p>The rehearsals over the marked-out course went on from day
to day, sometimes in the presence of the Divisional Commander,
Major-General Gorringe, and nearly always in the presence
of the Brigade Commander, Brigadier-General Kennedy, with
various members of the gilded staff in the offing. Still, the
Civil Service Rifles, equipped with two Lieutenant-Colonels, and
fired with enthusiasm, disarmed criticism, and the Generals
regarded Glencorse Wood and the curiously-named Nonne
Boschen (Nuns’ Wood) as practically captured. They had,
however, reckoned without the weather.</p>

<p>The big offensive which took place in the Ypres Salient from
July to September, 1917, is remembered more by the atrocious
weather which accompanied it throughout&mdash;and finally ruined
it&mdash;than by any other feature. Hopes had run high, as details
of the ambitious scheme leaked out, that this great push was
going to hasten very considerably the end of the war. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
Bosche evidently feared that such might be the result, to judge
from the stubborn resistance he put up, and the number of
big guns he brought to bear on the district, and it was the eternal
shelling during these three months, combined with what was
probably a record in bad weather even for France, which caused
men ever after to speak with bated breath of “Passchendaele.”</p>

<p>To have been through Passchendaele was regarded as having
endured the most severe trial of the war, but “Passchendaele”
when referred to in this connection, included not only the little
village of that name and the ridge adjoining it, but the whole
of the devastated area in the Ypres Salient where the fighting
was so keen during the last wretched months of the so-called
summer of 1917. Passchendaele, therefore, can be stretched
to include Glencorse and Polygon Woods and the Westhoek
Ridge, for here the full fury of this terrible battle against the
combined forces of the Bosche and the weather was felt, and as
far as the Civil Service Rifles were concerned, they were knocked
out by the weather before they reached the “starting gate.”</p>

<p>Throughout the last few days of August the rain fell almost
continuously. The marsh referred to, through which two
men had to wade, had now become a pond, and the rest of the
country on Westhoek Ridge had become a sea of mud. The
attack, after being postponed from day to day, was finally
abandoned on the 31st of August, when the advance party,
under the Adjutant, was actually on parade ready to start for
the trenches. A limber containing medical stores, signalling
equipment, etc., had already been despatched for the Menin
Road, where it was to await the advance party. The advance
party was dismissed, the limber brought back, and later in the
evening it became known that the attack was definitely abandoned
so far as the 47th Division was concerned.</p>

<p>The news created something akin to consternation in the
Battalion, where the men felt the keenest disappointment at the
loss of such an opportunity to prove their worth, but none felt
it more keenly than Colonel Parish. It transpired that he had
not recovered from his head wound received on the Somme
in 1916,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> and he was therefore to return to England, but he had
succeeded in persuading the authorities to allow him to see
this battle through before going away. It thus came as a very
bitter blow to him, who had devoted so much energy and zeal
to improving the fighting spirit, that he should have to leave
without ever having commanded his Battalion in the front line.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">14</a>
This wound contributed to his untimely death on 9th Oct., 1921. He
is buried at Hawarden.</p></div>

<p>His grief was shared by all ranks in the Battalion, for although
he had only been in command for six weeks, he had worked a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
wonderful change, and had inspired every one by his enthusiasm
for the Civil Service Rifles.</p>

<p>There was not an officer, N.C.O. or man who had served under
him who did not feel how very much the Regiment owed to
Colonel Parish. It had been a real pleasure to serve under him
in any capacity, and there was a genuine and universal regret
felt at his departure. The benefit of his six weeks’ command
was felt in the Battalion throughout the rest of the war.</p>

<p>Colonel Parish said good-bye on parade on the 23rd of September,
when he told the men how sorry he was to go, but assured
them all that it was only for a little while, for he would be back
as soon as the powers that be would allow him. He felt sure that
when that time came, Colonel Segrave, to whom he was handing
over his command, would be able to tell him that this was still
the finest Battalion in the Division.</p>

<p>This, then, was the explanation of the “quiet, unobtrusive
Colonel in the Scotch cap” who had been living with the Civil
Service Rifles for the past fortnight. He had a difficult task
before him, coming as he did, after one who had become such
a hot favourite with all under his command. Colonel Segrave
did not start off with the “new broom” tactics, for there was
very little that he wished to alter, and it was his desire to continue
on the lines of his predecessor. He told the Battalion,
when he took his first parade on the 4th of September, how
proud he was to be given command of the Civil Service Rifles,
but it is safe to say that not even he guessed how great was to
be his love for this Regiment before the end of his r&eacute;gime.</p>

<p>Very soon afterwards the Battalion relieved the 2nd South
Lancashire Battalion in support trenches round about Hooge
and Ch&acirc;teau Wood on the Menin Road, and here were spent
the last seven days of the eleven months’ sojourn in the Ypres
Salient. The experience of these seven days was a fitting conclusion
to all that had been endured in the past year, for they
were days during which the Salient lived up to its worst reputation.</p>

<p>The relief of the 2nd South Lancashires was carried out in
daylight on the 9th of September, and the Bosches welcomed
the change by indulging in a general bombardment of the area,
which caused a few casualties in “A” Company before they
reached their new positions.</p>

<p>The Battalion was disposed round about the site of the village
of Hooge. There were no trenches, although there were several
marked on the map, and the sole accommodation was found
in old concrete shelters which until recently had housed the
Germans. “A” Company, however, occupied part of the Menin
tunnel, which had once been a triumph of German field engineering.
This ran underneath the Menin Road, and inside had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
been a trench tramway, along which the enemy stores and
rations had been brought up. The main signal lines also ran
along, and it was noticed that these had been neatly pinned
into the walls of the tunnel&mdash;in contrast to the English method
of laying lines criss-cross along open trenches in such a manner
as to catch the occupants across the throat. This method of
fixing lines, so common throughout the British area, caused
more bad language on a dark night than any other provocation
in France.</p>

<div id="i155" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i155.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Menin tunnel may have been a safe refuge in the early
days of its existence, but now it was in a deplorable condition.
Daylight was admitted at very frequent intervals by the huge
gaping holes caused by the heavy artillery of both sides, but
in spite of these the atmosphere inside was almost overpowering,
and the protection from shell fire was purely imaginary.</p>

<p>Gas shells were scattered freely over the area both day and
night, and the casualties increased each day. During the
bombardment of the night of the 11th of September, Lance-Corporal
Foote, of the Headquarters Pioneers, distinguished
himself by carrying a wounded man from the ruins in Ch&acirc;teau
Wood occupied by Battalion Headquarters right down the
Menin Road to the dressing station at the famous Birr cross roads.</p>

<p>The discomforts increased each day, and the bombardments of
the main track to the front line&mdash;the Kanwan track, which
had formerly taken place at regular times each day, now became
more frequent and irregular. The whole Battalion made the
perilous journey along this track nearly every day, for huge
carrying parties had to be provided to carry R. E. material
and ammunition up to Clapham Junction&mdash;the Headquarters
of the front line Battalion. There were many signs of the
recent advance to be seen on the way to Clapham Junction,
the most noticeable being a mass of ruined tanks which looked
as though they had all been put out of action in trying to mount
the embankment along a part of the Menin Road.</p>

<p>On the 15th of September began a series of practice barrages,
and the long-suffering infantry now had to endure the retaliation
in addition to other bombardments. Following one of the
practice barrages the 7th Battalion, holding the front line,
sent forward a party and captured a strong point. “C” Company,
under Captain L. L. Burtt, went up at night to work
for them, and their journey along Kanwan Track ranks as one
of the worst experiences of the Company during the war. Misfortune
befell the party from the start, and the intense shelling
combined with the pitch-black darkness of the night caused
the journey to Clapham Junction to degenerate into a scramble.
This was practically the closing incident in the eleven months
spent in the Ypres Salient, for on the following afternoon the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
2nd Australian Infantry Battalion arrived, and the Civil Service
Rifles made their way down the Menin Road, strewn with all
the d&eacute;bris of war, with here and there a dead horse, and so to
Ch&acirc;teau Segard, where one night was spent before marching
to the village of Steenvoorde and saying good-bye for ever to
the hated Ypres Salient.</p>

<p>The departure from the Salient was not without its thrills for
the Lewis Gunners, who had been left with their guns on the
Menin Road near Hooge awaiting the limbers. These had to
pass a corner on the Ypres side of Birr Cross Roads known as
Hell Fire Corner, and it so happened on this evening that the
spot was justifying its name, for it had been shelled so heavily
that the dump of R.E. material and ammunition by the roadside
was all ablaze&mdash;thus completely shutting off the Transport.
This state of affairs lasted for some hours, but Sergeant Sladden
solved the difficulty by taking his limbers round by a devious
route through Zillebeke, and eventually got the limbers away
without loss.</p>

<p>The Transport Section had had many exciting trips along
the Menin Road, and they were proud of the fact that they were
able to leave the Ypres Salient without having lost a horse in
that area.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<span class="medium">ANOTHER REST CURE. GAVRELLE AND OPPY</span></h2>

<p>The long march to Steenvoorde&mdash;17 miles&mdash;was endured cheerfully
by all ranks, who were overjoyed at leaving Belgium. It
was felt that whatever the new area was like, it would not be
worse than the experience of the past few weeks. What a
tremendous change from the haven of rest of eleven months
ago! There were many who would even prefer to go through
the Somme experience of a year ago rather than return to the
Menin Road.</p>

<p>Those who had been left out as “non-starters” for the battle
which did not take place rejoined at Eecke, a little village near
Caestre, where two days were spent before the Battalion entrained
at Caestre shortly after midnight on the 22nd of
September, and started in the best of spirits for the Arras front.</p>

<p>After resting for two nights at the delightful village of Frevin-Capelle,
near the source of the Scarpe, a short march in delightful
weather brought the Civil Service Rifles to Aubrey Camp&mdash;a
camp of Nissen huts and tents on the Lens-Arras Road near
Roclincourt. A night spent in Aubrey Camp was followed by
a march to the front line at Gavrelle where old friends were
found in the Drake Battalion of the 63rd (Naval) Division.
This Battalion had been attached to the Civil Service Rifles for
instruction in trench warfare at Souchez in June 1916.</p>

<p>There followed a spell of peace and quiet which compared
very favourably even with the early days at Ypres. The
absence of shelling was very noticeable and the trenches were
clean and dry. Moreover there was an occasional deep dug-out
and as the ground was chalky&mdash;it was the southern extremity of
Vimy Ridge&mdash;more were to be dug by the Royal Engineers.
There were never many deep dug-outs in English trenches, but
whenever the ground was suitable there were always a good
many either under construction or proposed.</p>

<p>There was a good water supply from a well in the trenches,
and rations were brought to within 100 yards of Battalion
Headquarters, and the Battalion held the front line for eight
days without showing any sign of wear. Everyone was happy,
except perhaps the energetic Commanding Officer, who wanted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
to get on with the war. He had little or no use for the quiet
life of Gavrelle and seemed happier amid the turmoil of the
Ypres Salient.</p>

<p>It was intended that the Division should make a long stay
in this sector, and elaborate plans for a winter scheme of defence
were made by the Divisional Commander. As in the Ypres
Salient, a Battalion when out at rest was always to occupy the
same camp&mdash;in order to encourage the men to work on camp
improvements. The Civil Service Rifles accordingly set to
work on Aubrey Camp, and Colonel Segrave claims that his
men laid more trench boards per acre than could be found at
any other place on the Western front. He also established the
Battalion Baths, so that henceforth the Civil Service Rifles
would be independent of the Divisional Baths Officer.</p>

<p>Football matches, trips to Arras, and the concerts given by the
Divisional Follies were the chief diversions, and, at the end of
October, a very successful Regimental concert was held in the
Divisional Cinema, the surprise turn of the evening being the
R.S.M.’s rendering of “Take me back to dear old Blighty.”</p>

<p>The good spirits of the troops were further raised by a very
welcome increase in the leave allotment, which for some time
had been very poor, and all leave records were broken on the 6th
of November when a party of sixty other ranks left by the light
railway from Roclincourt en route for “Blighty.”</p>

<p>The Transport and Quartermaster’s Stores were housed in
Roclincourt in the most comfortable billets they had had for
some months. It was here that the Transport Section received
a shock in the shape of a comb-out by the Commanding Officer.
Colonel Segrave was a keen student of man power, and in
investigating the strength of his Battalion, he found the
Transport Section considerably overstaffed, with the result that
eleven of them rejoined their Companies in the trenches.</p>

<p>The sectors of the front line held by the Civil Service Rifles
were alternately the Gavrelle Sector, and the posts just south
of Oppy Wood. Of these the Gavrelle sector was much the
more popular, though neither could compare with the support
positions in the Railway Cutting and Roundhay Camp, just by
the Arras-Bailleul Road.</p>

<p>It was while at Roundhay Camp that the peaceful life was
disturbed by startling rumours of a move to another front, and
on the 15th of November, weight was given to the rumours by
the sudden closing of the Brigade School. Leave, it was said,
was stopped, and amid consternation groups of men gathered
all over the camp to discuss the situation, those who wanted
to be funny talking of ice cream and stilettos&mdash;for it was understood
the Division was bound for Italy.</p>

<p>The “holiday” in the Arras district came to an abrupt end
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
on the 18th of November, when the 13th East Yorks Battalion
arrived, and the Civil Service Rifles left by Light Railway, and
after a merry trip in the toy train, reached a camp of French
huts at Ecoivres. There, in spite of rumours, a party of thirty
other ranks went on leave, but speculation was rife as to whether
they would complete their full time.</p>

<p>A few days were spent at Ecoivres, with many football
matches, which included a Rugby trial match on the 20th of
November. Interest in the Rugby match was diverted by the
news, which arrived during the game, of the brilliant success
of the 3rd Army near Cambrai. The attack had been kept
secret, and the news came as a great surprise. It was said the
Hindenburg Line was broken, the cavalry and tanks were
pursuing the retreating enemy, and Cambrai itself would soon
fall. In fact, the war would soon be over. Orders received
that night for a move on the morrow gave rise to further
speculation as to the destination of the Division, and at the
“calling over of the card” in the Officers’ Mess, the betting was
evens Cambrai, 6-4 Italy, and 100-1 England.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The movements of the Division during the last ten days of
November, 1917, were such as would baffle the keenest member
of the enemy Intelligence Department. Units appeared to be
moving from one village to another with no particular object
in view, and during the first few days of the trek from Ecoivres
the Battalion Commanders themselves had no idea whether they
were bound for Italy or the Cambrai front. The Civil Service
Rifles started with a succession of short marches, and as a rule
the billets were poor and the villages somewhat squalid. There
was, however, little time to “grouse,” for the order to move on
was usually received before the men had time to look round.
After a night in billets at Hermaville and a night of extreme
discomfort in dilapidated huts at Wanquetin, the village of
Gouy en Artois was reached, where it was learnt that the
Division was now in the Fifth Corps (3rd Army) and it was
evident therefore that the move to Italy was “off.”</p>

<p>On the 24th of November the Battalion occupied a hutted
camp in Courcelles le Comte, a ruined village won from the
Bosches during their winter retreat of 1916. The roads and
hamlets in this district were still clearly marked with the big
signboards erected during the German occupation, and at one
end of Courcelles could be seen the remains of a German cinema
or theatre.</p>

<p>The camp itself had been built by English troops, and had
at one time been a well laid out camp of Nissen huts; but now
it was the abomination of desolation. The linings of the huts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
had been torn off for firewood, the windows were broken, the
doors torn off their hinges, and every hut was strewn with
rubbish. Fortunately only one night was spent in these
conditions, and the march was resumed the next afternoon.</p>

<p>The march to Le Transloy on the 25th of November was
unique. For the first hour everything went well, but from that
time onwards the column was rarely on the move for more
than ten minutes every hour. The usual order of things was
thus reversed, and instead of a ten minutes halt in every hour,
there was a ten minutes march per hour. Every road leading into
Bapaume was choked with troops, and a perspiring A.P.M.
was trying to sort out those bound for the front from those
coming out into reserve.</p>

<p>Tea was served in the twilight on the Bapaume Road, and
the next halt found the Battalion in the main street of the town.
There were some there who had hoped to see Bapaume in 1916,
but although they had ample opportunity to admire the ruins
in the bright moonlight, they had now lost all interest in their
surroundings, and many passed through without even knowing
the name of the place.</p>

<p>Thoroughly fed up, the troops reached their camp shortly
before midnight, and to crown a very miserable day they were
so frightfully crowded into the huts that they could scarcely
find room to lie down. “Posh Harry” was almost speechless
when he saw his billet. “What I want to know,” he spluttered,
“is where did the R.S.M. of the Guards sleep last night?
They say the Guards were here, but I’m sure their R.S.M.
would not sleep in there.”</p>

<p>The discomfort of that camp, however, was eclipsed on the
night of the 27th of November, when the Battalion bivouacked
in a field of rich creamy mud at Doignies, the journey from Le
Transloy having been made by bus to Velu, and thence by
route march, each man carrying his blanket over his arm.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br />

<span class="medium">BOURLON WOOD AND THE HINDENBURG LINE</span></h2>

<p>Two of the most serious checks to the 3rd Army advance on
Cambrai were the villages of Bourlon and Fontaine Notre Dame,
respectively at the north-west and south-east corners of
Bourlon Wood. The latter village, too, was almost at the
entrance to Cambrai on the Bapaume-Cambrai road.</p>

<p>Both these villages had been captured towards the end of
November, but were afterwards retaken. The Guards Division,
who had preceded the 47th Division, accordingly attacked them
again, and before the Civil Service Rifles left Le Transloy it
was learned that the attack had succeeded, though the enemy
very soon recaptured both villages once more.</p>

<p>It was understood, however, that the English advance was
to continue, and when the Civil Service Rifles reached Doignies,
the battle surplus had already been sent back to the Divisional
Reinforcement Camp. As the situation in the front line underwent
such frequent changes, there had been nothing in the
nature of a rehearsal of the coming battle, which it was expected
would be more in the nature of open warfare than had been any
of the previous operations of the 47th Division.</p>

<p>On arriving at Doignies, Colonel Segrave received orders for
his Battalion to occupy part of the Hindenburg Line on the
following day (the 28th), and at a very early hour, he started
with his Adjutant, Medical Officer, Signals Officer and four
Company Commanders for the Headquarters of the front line
brigade. The Battalion, in fighting order, moved off later in
the morning and occupied a part of the Hindenburg Line nearly
due west of Graincourt.</p>

<p>At Brigade Headquarters Colonel Segrave learnt that he was
to relieve one of the Cavalry regiments holding the front line
in Bourlon Wood, but the date of relief was not then settled.
He therefore took his party across country, passing within a
hundred yards or so of Graincourt, across sunken roads, to a
sugar factory on the Bapaume-Cambrai road, where it was
understood a guide would be found.</p>

<p>Leaving the sugar factory, many signs of the recent advance
were seen, German equipment, rifles and ammunition being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
scattered almost everywhere. Derelict English tanks and
aeroplanes were also to be seen, and the landscape generally
presented a desolate picture.</p>

<p>The Cavalry Headquarters occupied what had been a pretty
chalet in a delightful spot in the middle of the wood&mdash;an ideal
place for a summer picnic. There was no suggestion of a
summer picnic about it now, however, for the bitter fighting of
the past few days had left its mark everywhere, and in and
around the chalet were gathered weary warriors, eagerly awaiting
the news of their relief.</p>

<div id="i163" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i163.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Sketch Map to illustrate the movements of the C.S.R. from 28 Nov. 1917 to 6 Dec. 1917</span></p>
</div>

<p>The members of the reconnoitring party had only just thrown
off their equipment for a rest when it was found that they had
been brought to the wrong place, so, dispensing with the
doubtful services of a guide, Colonel Segrave led his officers
through the wood in search of some one willing to be relieved by
his Battalion. The right place was found to be in a small
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
German dug-out in the road leading to the village of Bourlon
along the western edge of the wood, and here the Colonel,
learning that he was to take over that night the positions
held by the 2nd Dismounted Cavalry Brigade and the 2nd/5th
West Yorks Battalion, made his dispositions and set off with
his Adjutant and Medical Officer to find his Battalion in the
Hindenburg Line. The Company Commanders remained behind
to look round their respective fronts.</p>

<p>On his way back, Colonel Segrave surprised a member of the
R.A.M.C. at a dressing station by begging from him a tin of
bully beef and a biscuit. The spectacle of a Colonel eating
bully beef was too much for the R.A.M.C. man, who stared
after the three officers as though he had seen ghosts.</p>

<p>A long wait for orders in the Hindenburg Line ended in the
Battalion moving off without any at 9.0 p.m. There was a
bright moon, and the night was perfectly quiet at the start,
when there was nothing to suggest the exciting time that was
in store for the troops before they were to arrive at the front
line. But on reaching the Relay Post on the Cambrai road,
where the guides and Company Commanders were to have been,
the head of the Battalion became enveloped in a barrage of
gas shells. The rest of the journey was what is known as
“windy” in the extreme. Gas masks had to be worn, and in
pushing through the barrage, some casualties were suffered,
one platoon of “C” Company losing very heavily after passing
Battalion Headquarters.</p>

<p>The relief was complete at about 2.0 a.m., and except for gas
shelling the situation became much quieter.</p>

<p>“B” and “D” Companies held the front line, the former,
under Lieutenant C. M. Kilner, being on the left, just outside
the southern edge of the village, and with half a Company on
each side of the road leading from Battalion Headquarters to
the village. “D” Company, under Captain R. Middleton,
connected with the right of “B” and held a position inside the
wood and about 300 yards south-east of the village. “D”
Company Headquarters was in a most palatial deep-dug out which
had formerly been the Headquarters of a German artillery brigade.
“C” Company, under Captain T. H. Sharratt, was in support
near “D”. Soon after taking up their positions, both “B”
and “D” Companies sent out patrols towards the village, but
although Lieutenant W. E. Hoste took his patrol into the
village, and entered one or two houses, no Bosches were found.</p>

<p>The quiet night was followed by a distinctly noisy day,
throughout which the enemy heavily bombarded the front line
positions, the whole of the wood, and the roads all round the
outside of the wood.</p>

<p>In the middle of the morning, the Brigadier arrived with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
news that there would be no further advance, and that the
positions now being held were to be consolidated. “A”
Company, who were in reserve, under Lieutenant L. C. Morris,
M.C., round about Battalion Headquarters, accordingly spent
the rest of the day in carrying barbed wire, pickets, sandbags
and ammunition from a dump at the cross roads known as
Anneux Chapel to a forward dump near Battalion Headquarters.
The casualties during the day amounted to one officer and no
less than fifty four other ranks&mdash;a pretty heavy toll for a day
when no attack took place!</p>

<div id="i164" class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">BOURLON WOOD FROM SOUTH-WEST CORNER, 1917.</p>

<p class="author xsmall"><i>To face page 164.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In the opinion of those holding the line, the decision not to
advance any further was unnecessary&mdash;it was felt that the
Battalion might well be engaged very soon in defensive rather
than offensive operations, and some such idea was in the mind
of Colonel Segrave as he went round the Battalion front that
day.</p>

<p>Any remaining doubts as to the enemy intentions were dispersed
on the morning of the 30th of November, which opened
with an intense bombardment from German guns of every
calibre. Smoke barrages were put down on the flanks of the
intended attack, and before long the enemy infantry could be
seen advancing in many waves from the country beyond Bourlon
village. The Battalion was not in signal communication with
anybody, either Brigade Headquarters or adjoining units, and
the Commanding Officer had therefore to rely on the services
of runners and four pigeons. According to the rules of the
signal service, pigeons had to be despatched in pairs, so the stock
was only good for two messages. When it is mentioned that
it took a good runner well over an hour to reach Brigade, the
state of isolation of the Battalion will be realised.</p>

<p>The battle raged throughout the morning without any infantry
engagement on the front held by the Civil Service Rifles, though
S.O.S. rockets were seen on several occasions on adjoining
sections of the line.</p>

<p>Company Commanders reported that the attack appeared to
be directed on the sectors held on each side of them, but up to
midday they had not been interfered with. The waves of enemy
infantry had advanced diagonally across their front, and both
“B” and “D” Companies had put in some excellent work
with rifles and Lewis guns. The enemy, however, was extraordinarily
well served by his low-flying aeroplanes, which seemed
to swarm like bees over the Battalion area, and the machine-gun
fire from these caused a good many casualties during the
day.</p>

<p>Prominent among the early incidents of the battle was the
performance of Lance Corporal S. Fletcher of the Battalion scouts,
and a “D” Company runner who brought the first report from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
the front line to Battalion Headquarters. The distance they had
to cover was more than a mile over very rough country, but in
their anxiety to deliver the result of their observations as quickly
as possible they ran the whole way, although fully equipped, and
carrying rifles. The effort proved too much for the runner, who
collapsed on reaching Battalion Headquarters, and fell unconscious
down the stairs of the dug-out without being able to
deliver his message. The N.C.O. was little better off, but
after a time he recovered sufficiently to be able to give a good
account of what was going on.</p>

<p>Soon after midday the S.O.S. signal was seen on the Battalion
front, and it was reported that a gap had been made in the
Brigade front on the left of the line held by “B” Company.</p>

<p>The Support Company, “C,” led by 2nd Lieutenant C. V.
Marchant, had by this time moved up to reinforce “B” and
“D” Companies, who had both suffered heavy losses. The
remnants of the left platoon of “B” Company, finding the line
originally held by the Battalion on their left to be unoccupied,
pushed along to try to find touch. Instead of finding their
friends, however, they found Bosches in large numbers, who
appeared to come from all sides, with the result that about ten
of the Civil Service Rifles were taken prisoners.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Kilner, observing the enemy in the left rear of the
Battalion front, gathered the rest of his Company together and
formed a defensive flank in the sunken road on the Western edge
of the wood. Meanwhile, Colonel Segrave formed up the
personnel of Battalion Headquarters and his reserve Company,
“A,” and led them in two waves across the open country outside
the wood. Leaving the vicinity of Battalion Headquarters
at about 4.0 p.m., they advanced through heavy fire from rifles,
machine guns, and low-flying aeroplanes, and although they
suffered many casualties, they succeeded before dusk in restoring
the line as originally held, and later in the evening established
touch on the left with the Post Office Rifles, who had come up
from Brigade Reserve to reinforce the line. The example set
by their Commanding Officer inspired the men of the Civil Service
Rifles with such confidence and enthusiasm, that they carried
out their advance as at a Salisbury Plain manœuvre, the Colonel,
with a map in one hand and a whistle in the other, giving his
directions by signal.</p>

<p>Colonel Segrave’s prompt action was specially commended
in a pamphlet afterwards published by General Headquarters
entitled “The Story of a Great Fight,” and those who were with
him on that day regard it as the finest example of leadership in
the history of the Battalion. There was nothing theatrical about
the affair&mdash;it was just done in the calm and methodical manner
in which Colonel Segrave always behaved in the front line.

<p>The effects of the continuous gas shelling during the past three
days had told heavily on the Battalion&mdash;particularly the Headquarters
Company and “A” Company. Of the Headquarters
Officers, Colonel Segrave was the only one remaining on the
night of the 30th of November, and during the day he had lost
no less than four Adjutants, the last one being an Artillery
Liaison Officer whom he had converted into an infantryman.
The other ranks of Headquarters fared no better, but the losses
in the Companies holding the front line were heavier still, and
when the 1st Surrey Rifles arrived on the night of the 1st of
December, and the Civil Service Rifles moved back into tents at
Femy Wood near Havrincourt, the losses in Bourlon Wood
were found to be 12 officers, 278 other ranks. At Femy Wood
it was found that the Colonel himself was badly gassed, and he
too left for hospital on the 2nd of December.</p>

<p>Although it is not possible here to pay just tribute to those
gallant fellows individually, special mention must be made of
the great loss the Battalion suffered by the death of three of
its members who had already done great things, and who would
have risen to higher rank in the Regiment before long had they
been spared.</p>

<p>C.S.M. Mansbridge, of “D” Company, was as gallant in the
front line as he was smart and efficient on the parade ground.
An old member of the Regiment who thoroughly understood his
brother Warrant Officers, N.C.O.’s, and men, he would undoubtedly
have made an ideal Regimental Sergeant Major for the
Civil Service Rifles.</p>

<p>Sergeant H. L. Smith, who was acting C.S.M. of “A”
Company, had a multitude of friends in all Companies.
As “Inky” Smith he had been one of the shining lights
of the Lewis gunners, of whom he was one of the first members.
He had fought with distinction at Vimy Ridge, and on the
Somme, and, like Mansbridge, he was a “17th of March man.”
Both were men who quickly won the respect of all who served
with them.</p>

<p>Second Lieutenant C. V. Marchant, of “C” Company, was a
comparatively young member of the Regiment. Not yet twenty
years old, he had just completed a year’s service with the Battalion
in France, and during that time he had become very
popular with the men of “C” Company, with whom he had
served gallantly in the Ypres Salient, and particularly at the
battle of Messines. He was cool in battle, keen and fearless.
He met his death while leading his Company through the awful
barrage of shells and machine gun bullets, but he faced it unflinchingly.
The Battalion could ill afford to lose such an officer,
who in spite of his youth would soon have made an excellent
Company Commander.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span></p>

<p>“C” Company also lost two valuable members in C.S.M.
F. C. Robertson, D.C.M., who was severely wounded on
the 29th of November, and Sergeant O. L. H. Levey,
wounded on the 30th. Both were “17th of March men,” and
Robertson had been a member of the Regiment for many years
before the war. He was a quiet unassuming fellow, who was
never found wanting, and who was never “rattled” even under
the greatest provocation and in the most trying circumstances.</p>

<p>Sergeant Levey was a most enthusiastic member of the Regiment
who had distinguished himself by his skill with the rifle.
Fortunately he recovered sufficiently from his wounds to return
to the Regiment some months later, when he quickly rose to the
rank of C.S.M. of his Company. His prowess in the football
field gained him fame not only in the Battalion, but throughout
the Division.</p>

<p>In addition to the fighting portion of the Battalion, the Transport
Section and Quartermaster’s staff suffered casualties in and
around Bourlon Wood, the Quartermaster himself, Lieutenant
W. G. Hodge, better known as “Ben Hodge,” being gassed on
the night of the 29th November while at Battalion Headquarters.
On the same night the Transport Column was heavily shelled on
the Bapaume-Cambrai Road, with the result that several of
the most experienced drivers and horses were wounded.</p>

<p>But in spite of the heavy casualties in Bourlon Wood, and the
fact that the enemy bombardment was the most severe and
prolonged that the Battalion was called upon to face during the
war, the men of the Civil Service Rifles could look back with
justifiable pride on their share in the battle, during which they
did not yield an inch of ground, although the Bosches gained
considerable success in neighbouring parts of the line.</p>

<p>The remnants of the Battalion numbered only about 200,
all ranks, when they reached Femy Wood on the 2nd of December
with scarcely a kick left in them after their exertions of the
past few days, and it came as a great surprise when they had to
return to the front line on the 4th of December reinforced by a
handful of officers and other ranks from the “non-starters’
camp.”</p>

<p>In order to cover the withdrawal of the 142nd Infantry Brigade
from Bourlon Wood, a defensive position on either side of the
village of Graincourt was taken up, and there, on the 5th and
6th of December, the Battalion gave yet another exhibition of
splendid fighting qualities in its second defensive battle within
a week.</p>

<p>The officers who had come up included Major H. Marshall,
who was in command of the Battalion, Major H. F. M. Warne,
who acted as his second in command, and Captain L. L. Burtt,
who commanded “C” and “D” Companies, now formed into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
one Company. “A” and “B” Companies were amalgamated
under Lieutenant L. C. Morris, M.C.</p>

<p>The positions were taken up at dusk, “A” and “B” Companies
being on the left along a sunken road running in a north-westerly
direction from about the centre of the village, and
“C” and “D” on the right were along a similar road which
ran due east from the village. The village itself was not occupied,
but posts were established near the cemetery in the sunken
roads north-east of the village. These were withdrawn at
dawn. The 2nd Division was on the left of “A” and “B”
Companies, and the 59th Division was on the right of “C”
and “D” Companies.</p>

<p>The troops from the front line in Bourlon Wood passed through
as arranged, the evacuation of the wood having been rendered
necessary owing to the forcing in by the Germans of both arms
of the Cambrai Salient.</p>

<p>The whole front was patrolled throughout the night, but until
daylight nothing was seen or heard of the enemy, whose front
line was about two miles away. Numerous explosions heard in
the wood showed that the Royal Engineers were destroying dug-outs
and anything likely to be of use to the enemy.</p>

<p>The garrison on the right, numbering less than 120, all ranks,
after trying to dig themselves in in the frost bound ground along
the side of the road, moved forward to a well-camouflaged German
trench which started just outside the village and continued
almost to the 59th Division on the right. Leading out of the back
of the trench were four old gun pits with the dismantled 5&middot;9’s
still there, and at the village end was a trench running forward
at right angles.</p>

<p>It should be mentioned that at the outset it was understood
that the garrison would be withdrawn after twenty-four hours,
but, as after events show, the troops were doomed to disappointment.</p>

<p>The two halves of the Battalion were not in touch with each
other at all, and as they fought during these few days as separate
units, their experiences are dealt with separately.</p>

<p>At daylight on the 5th of December it was seen from the
trench occupied by “C” and “D” Companies that the Germans
had discovered the withdrawal from Bourlon Wood, for small
parties of them were seen wandering about the deserted front
line and in the wood itself, great interest being shown in a derelict
tank, which was subsequently used as a signal station.</p>

<p>It was not, however, until the afternoon that the enemy
approached to within reasonable distance of Graincourt, but
his patrols now became very active, first coming on in small
parties, which were easily dispersed by rifle and Lewis gun fire,
and later in larger numbers, which were also dispersed in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
same way. Some excellent shooting was indulged in about
this time by the gallant little bands on either side of the village,
but although they were able to keep the enemy off while the
daylight lasted, it was obvious that the small force defending
the village would not be able to prevent him from entering
Graincourt during the night. With the coming of darkness
it was found that a considerable number of Germans had reached
the village, for patrols and even ration parties encountered
them, both in front and in rear of the defending garrison.
Runners were also involved in small fights, which were quite
frequent during the night on the fringes of the village. In one
of these a German machine gun team was overwhelmed, the
gun and one man being captured, and the rest of the team being
killed.</p>

<p>Just as the men of “C” and “D” Companies were expecting
to be withdrawn, Major Warne arrived from Battalion Headquarters
to take command of the garrison on the right, with
orders to hold the position for another twenty-four hours, and,
on withdrawal, to occupy a strong post in the rear.</p>

<p>One must have endured the strain of prolonged fighting in
a precarious position, worn out by constant watching, with
little food or water, and many other discomforts too numerous
to mention, in order to realise how intense was the disappointment
of these men who, thinking that Major Warne came to tell
them their work was done and to take them back to rest, learnt
that their job had only just begun.</p>

<p>At about 5.0 a.m. on the 6th, a Lewis gun was posted in
the road about 300 yards south of the village with orders to deal
with the enemy there as far as possible, but to withdraw if the
opposition became too strong, to a strong post about a mile
further down the road towards the village of Flesquieres. An
enemy patrol soon tried to rush the gun, but without success,
and a wounded prisoner was captured as a result.</p>

<p>At daylight two parties tried to rush the gun. Both were
beaten off, but not before the gun team had suffered two casualties.
As other parties of the enemy were on the move for a
further attack, the gun team was ordered to withdraw to the
aforementioned point, where the gun was soon in action again in
helping to repel an attack on the strong point itself.</p>

<p>Meantime Major Warne’s force was still holding on, and the
incidents of the 6th of December are thus described by Sergeant
C. Manthorp, who, with Sergeant E. Cooke, was conspicuous
throughout the operation by gallantry and good leadership:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“When dawn broke on the 6th, we were very much on the alert
to see what surprises were in store for us, and directly we could see
any distance we were well rewarded. The whole German army
seemed to be advancing, line after line, crossing the skyline and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
coming directly for us. Fortunately for us their orders were
obviously not to attack, for when the front line got to within 600
or 700 yards from our trench, they started digging in, or at least
making a trench sufficiently deep for protection from our fire.
Whilst the advancing and entrenching was proceeding, we, of course,
indulged in a fair amount of rifle practice, and not without good
results, though, of course, the distance was rather great for anything
sensational. After digging-in, the Bosche lay quite dormant for
some hours, and we, of course, were on tenter-hooks to know what
his next move would be, for with the little force at our disposal, it
would have been hopeless to expect us to hold off what must have
been thousands of Bosches, should they have chosen to attack.</p>

<p>“It was early afternoon before the next move came. Then all
the lines of Bosches in front of us attacked, but right across our
front on to the 59th Division, the movement being for them a half
left movement. Then we had all the shooting we desired. The
machine-gunners had a fine time, and so did our riflemen, who were
mostly collected in the four gun pits, which were higher than the
floor of the trench and enabled us to fire over our camouflage, which
was composed of wire netting, turf, etc., and made firing from the
greater part of the trench impossible.</p>

<p>“By about 3.0 p.m. the Bosches appeared to have gone right
through the position held by the 59th Division, and it looked to us
as if the latter had been compelled to retire by weight of numbers.
Of course this made our position untenable with the Bosches in
our right, rear, and working round us, and the village between us
and the remainder of our Battalion also in enemy hands.</p>

<p>“About 70 yards in rear of our trench and parallel with it, ran
a sunken road, connecting the village on our left. Parties of Bosches
commenced to approach each way along this road, and this forced
us to withdraw most of our garrison from the trench and form a semi-circle
with each end resting on the road. Things soon became very
exciting, and then those of us who were out at the back of the trench,
received the order to retire. From the sunken road back to the
permanent front line must have been about 1&frac12; miles, and that
journey proved about the most exciting that any of us had experienced.
The party’s strength was two officers and probably about
100 other ranks, and the retirement was done in extended order.
At the start off we were received with fire from nearly every direction,
and also a little shell fire which may or may not have been meant for
us. After going about half a mile, we had the best part of the whole
business. We came across at least 100 of the enemy in more or less
close order, and did not actually discover them until they were
within about 100 yards of us, owing to the folds in the ground. It
is difficult to say who appeared to be the most surprised, they or us,
but we did not give them long to think about it. We flopped and
opened rapid fire on them, and also got our Lewis guns going. Our
Lewis gunners had been cursing about their loads, but we were
more than glad of the guns under the circumstances. This big
party of Bosches quickly took fright and it was laughable to see them
all double off back towards home like a flock of sheep. It was a
marvellous target, only about 200 or 300 yards away. You simply
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
couldn’t miss, and, of course, our success gave us great help on our
journey, for most of us were nearly done, owing to the bitter nights
we had had with no proper hot food. Having disposed of this body,
we encountered no further opposition from Fritz except occasional
rifle fire, and we took four stray Germans prisoners along with us.
We were then about three-quarters of a mile from our goal, and came
upon a small cable trench about three feet deep running towards our
lines. Just about this time, one of our own aeroplanes came upon
the scene and indulged in a little machine-gun practice on us, but
quickly discovered his mistake. Still, it all helped to cheer us on
the way. I was about the first to get into the cable trench, and with
the prisoners in front, led the way back to where the Royal Welsh
Fusiliers were holding the permanent line. They also mistook us
for Bosches, possibly because of the four prisoners in front, and
subjected us to rather severe machine-gun fire. It was not till I had
waved my shrapnel helmet for some time on top of my rifle as high
as I could hold it, that they recognised us as friends. Then one of
our officers, who happened to be with them, got out of the trench and
led us in. It appeared that they had already beaten off one attack
during the afternoon, so one could not be surprised at their mistaking
us for foes.</p>

<p>“After some delay we eventually got the remains of the two
Companies back to Rest Camp, whence we had started off on the
evening of the 4th. There were about 15 of ‘C’ Company who got
out and 40 of ‘D’ Company.</p>

<p>“Those of us who did get through can certainly look back upon
the affair as one of the most strenuous and exciting experiences we
had in France.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Sergeant Cooke has also written an excellent description
of the same action, which bears out his comrade’s story:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Daylight on the 6th found everything quiet, but during the
morning large bodies of troops were observed filing into Anneux&mdash;a
village between Graincourt and Bourlon Wood&mdash;and it was evident
that an attack from this direction was to be expected. The arrival
of a motor car, which was at first mistaken for a tank, caused some
excitement, but, apart from this and visits from scouting planes,
nothing of interest happened until about 3.0 p.m. when the attack
from Anneux was launched.</p>

<p>The attack, in the form of several waves of infantry, was mainly
directed against the positions right of Graincourt, leaving ‘A’ and
‘B’ Companies practically untouched.</p>

<p>The remaining Companies, leaving the gun pits and taking up
positions in the open from which more effective use of the rifle
could be made, opened a steady and accurate fire on the advancing
waves, with the result that the attack on their immediate front
crumpled up.</p>

<p>“Attention was now diverted to the right flank, where the enemy
appeared to be meeting with more success, and it was discovered
that the Battalion on the right had retired earlier in the day&mdash;their
withdrawal having been hidden from the Civil Service Rifles by
rising ground between the two positions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

<p>“The situation was now serious, as the enemy had closed round
the right rear of ‘C’ and ‘D’ Companies, whilst at the same time
the left rear of the position was threatened by troops from Graincourt,
and the order was given for the garrison to cut its way out
and make for the strong points in front of Flesquieres.</p>

<p>“Many casualties from machine-gun fire were suffered in getting
clear of the encircling troops, but about 50 of the two Companies
were left to continue the journey back to the strong points.</p>

<p>“After numerous encounters with isolated machine-gun posts
this party ran into some 200 or 300 of the enemy in an organised
line of shell holes before the positions in front of Flesquieres, where
the attack had been beaten off earlier in the afternoon, and, as the
line was well supplied with light machine guns, the chances of getting
through seemed decidedly slender until a Red Cross man advanced
making the usual signs of surrender.</p>

<p>“The effect was remarkable, for no sooner had his action been
seen than, with a yell, the Civil Service Rifles charged down on the
enemy, who, being taken by surprise, hastily crowded off into a
small valley, where they afforded excellent targets for the remaining
ammunition of the riflemen and Lewis gunners.</p>

<p>“A few prisoners were collected, and a fresh start made for the
British lines, but, owing to the gathering twilight the party was
mistaken for the enemy and subjected to heavy machine-gun fire
which caused further casualties.</p>

<p>“Eventually, by working their way down a shallow ditch
originally intended for a telephone cable, the battered remnant of
‘C’ and ‘D’ Companies managed to get near enough to attract the
attention of a machine-gun officer who guided them into the Strong
Point from which the long and slippery march back to Havrincourt
was commenced.”</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the withdrawal from Graincourt began, the right
garrison had been divided into two parties, the smaller, consisting
of Major Warne, Captain Burtt, Second-Lieutenants Potts
and Houslop, with about 20 or 30 other ranks, being in the
trench, and the larger party, under Second Lieutenants Lacy
and King, being outside. Second Lieutenant Lacy was wounded
during the withdrawal, and afterwards died of wounds, whilst
Second Lieutenant King was last seen in the rear of the party
as it withdrew, binding up a wounded N.C.O., and was afterwards
taken prisoner. The officers and men in the trench found
themselves surrounded by Boches, and after lying quiet for
some time they decided to try to work their way back to the
British lines.</p>

<p>Darkness had now fallen, and they had not gone far on their
journey before they ran into a large body of the enemy, who
took them prisoners and led them back through Graincourt
and Bourlon Wood, stopping at the late “D” Company
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
Headquarters, thence via Cambrai to Le Cateau, where they
were split up into different camps.</p>

<p>Much space has been given to the description of the action
of “C” and “D” Companies because, of the two halves of
the Battalion, their task was much the more complicated. “A”
and “B” Companies, on the left of the village, were in touch
with Battalion Headquarters throughout.</p>

<p>The big German attack on the 6th of December moved across
their front, but well away from their positions. They were
thus able to put in some excellent shooting with comparatively
little opposition from the enemy. Their patrols, however,
were frequently in contact with enemy patrols, and fought with
great credit in the numerous “street corner” fights on the
outskirts of the village.</p>

<p>The left garrison was withdrawn at 5.30 p.m. on the 6th,
and reached Havrincourt without any serious interruption.</p>

<p>The Regimental Aid Post was withdrawn at 6.0 p.m., all
the wounded who could be found having been sent down.</p>

<p>Battalion Headquarters reached Havrincourt shortly before
midnight, and after a day in tents in Havrincourt Wood, the
Battalion moved, on the 8th of December, to billets in the
village of Bertincourt, where at last there was time to pause
and count the cost. The stay in this village was simply a
repetition of the experience in Henencourt Wood in 1916, with
the melancholy writing of letters of condolence and despatching
of “effects.”</p>

<p>After a week spent at Bertincourt, where the remainder of
the “battle surplus” rejoined from the Divisional Reinforcement
Camp, the Battalion moved up to take over a piece of line in
front of Havrincourt. The troops had been hoping to go back
for a rest, and the return to the line came as a not very pleasant
surprise, and the statements of Company Commanders that the
Battalion would certainly be back at rest for Christmas were
received with a certain amount of scepticism.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood of Graincourt proved to be a less exciting
place on this occasion, and after six cold but uneventful days
the Battalion set off by train to the back area for a rest, and for
what was generally felt to be a well-deserved Christmas holiday.</p>

<p>Snow lay thick on the ground when the Battalion marched
into the village of Morlancourt, where it was to spend the rest.
If the weather was seasonable, that is more than could be said
for most of the billets, and a good deal of work had to be done
in some of them to obtain any degree of comfort. The Christmas
spirit, however, was abroad, and the troops, after their recent
experiences, were not in the mood to worry about minor discomforts.
The place was hardly one “to write home about,”
but the estaminets were plentiful and well stocked, and as a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
change from Bourlon Wood or even Bertincourt, the village of
Morlancourt, with all its drawbacks, was appreciated.</p>

<p>Parades were few, and preparations for Christmas festivities
were the order of the day. These were to take the form of
plenty to eat, plenty to drink, and concerts and sing-songs in
some of the largest halls and barns of the village. Time was too
short to permit of the production of a revue or pantomime,
though a cynic suggested that the authorities had some such
idea in their minds when they called on the Quartermaster’s
staff to provide a guard one evening.</p>

<p>The Christmas dinners were a great success. No building,
of course, could be found in the village to accommodate the
whole Battalion, but it was found possible for “A” and “B”
Companies to sit down to dinner together in one place, and
“C” and “D” in another. All the officers met together for
dinner later in the day.</p>

<p>The fare was varied and plentiful, joints of pork making a
welcome change from the everlasting beef and mutton of the
Army menu. Concerts and other forms of merrymaking passed
away the remainder of the day, and the good spirits of the troops
testified to their enjoyment of the Christmas festivities.</p>

<p>The sergeants were planning a dinner for the New Year, and
preparations were practically complete when a hard-hearted
Staff ordered a move to the neighbouring villages of Ribemont
and Mericourt, where the other Battalions of the Brigade were
already stationed. The remainder of the holiday was spent in
these villages, where the Civil Service Battalion, as last comer,
was unfortunate in the allotment of billets, and the men were
spread over a large area.</p>

<p>The postponed sergeants’ dinner, attended by the Commanding
Officer and acting Adjutant, was held at Ribemont.</p>

<p>On the 10th of January the Battalion moved back by train
to work, spending one night at Bertincourt before moving up to
support positions in the village of Ribecourt. Now followed two
tours, to the sectors in front of Ribecourt and Flesqui&egrave;res, during
which there is little outside the ordinary events of trench warfare
to record. While in reserve, the Battalion was stationed
at Bertincourt, a dilapidated village, where some of the billets
were Nissen huts and others damaged houses, and where the
chief feature at the time was mud. This neighbourhood was a
favourite one for the operations of the Boche night bombers.
The Civil Service Rifles had had previous experience of this
form of annoyance in billets, and in spite of the extra duties
occasioned by Lewis gun anti-aircraft posts, the troops soon
regarded the nightly visits of the planes as philosophically as
the most hardened Londoner.</p>

<p>At the beginning of February the man-power question was so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
acute in the British Infantry that it was decided to reduce
Infantry Brigades from four to three Battalions&mdash;“in order to
make a Brigade more mobile and more easily controlled by the
Brigade Commander,” said the official explanation. In the
47th Division the three Battalions to be broken up in consequence
of this order were the 6th, 7th, and 8th City of London Battalions,
who, with the Civil Service Rifles, had till then formed the 140th
Brigade. The 17th and 21st Battalions (Poplar and Stepneys
and First Surrey Rifles respectively) were transferred from the
other Brigades of the Division to complete the 140th. This
measure came to the Battalions broken up as an unexpected and
sudden shock, the force of which will be fully understood and
appreciated by every soldier who knows the strength of the
bonds which keep the members of a Battalion together. The
men of the Civil Service Rifles, realising what their own feelings
would have been if it had fallen to their lot to be split up, were
full of sympathy for the fellows who had been their comrades
and their rivals for nearly three years of active service.</p>

<p>A number of officers and other ranks of the 6th Battalion
were transferred to the Civil Service, and, in spite of the soreness
which they must have felt at the loss of the identity of the
Battalion whose high name and fame they had helped to win,
they settled down to give to their new unit the same wholehearted
service that they had given to their own.</p>

<p>One of the results of this reorganisation was the acquisition
by the Civil Service of the brass band of the 6th Battalion.
Strengthened by the inclusion of some of the more expert
musicians of the existing drum and fife band, this band, under
the direction of Sergeant W. H. Blackmore, quickly became one
of the most valuable assets of the Regiment, and remains so
to this day, for Mr. Blackmore still has charge of the Regimental
Band, which includes in its ranks the majority of the men who
served with him in France. The Regimental Band is one of
the most successful features of the post-war Civil Service Rifles.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br />

<span class="medium">THE RETREAT</span></h2>

<p>Although a big German offensive had been expected for some
weeks, and elaborate preparations to meet it had been made
during the winter months, there were few signs of the eve of a
big battle when the Civil Service Rifles, after a two hours’ train
journey from Etricourt, arrived at Winchester Valley late in
the evening of the 19th of March, and relieved the 1st Berkshire
Regiment (2nd Division) in Lincoln Reserve, the support line
on Beaucamp Ridge, near Villers Plouich. The Poplar and
Stepneys and London Irish were in the front line, and the 20th
of March passed off very quietly.</p>

<p>It was thought that the Brigade was in for another spell
of peaceful trench warfare, similar to those experienced before
the short and pleasant stay at Manancourt. The rumours of the
coming battle, which had been so strong during the winter
months, had, in fact, begun to die down. The optimistic went
so far as to think that the enemy attack would not take place,
whilst the “quietly confident,” thinking of the days of strenuous
digging on those wide trenches behind the Hindenburg Line&mdash;the
“Tank traps”&mdash;with the miles of barbed wire obstacles
which had been erected all around, felt that, even if the enemy
did launch a big attack, he would not get beyond the Hindenburg
Line. Not even the most pessimistic had imagined the great
crisis through which the Allied armies were to pass before another
month was over. Nor was there any indication in the daily
routine that the authorities were anticipating such a titanic
struggle in the near future. Leave, regarded by the soldier
as the most reliable “Military Barometer,” was still being
granted, and the allotment was indeed very much better than
at any other time during the war. Men were actually going
home on leave within six months of their last arrival in France,
and in such circumstances how could one take any but the
rosiest view of the future? The German attack, if it came off
at all, would probably be a repetition of Bourlon Wood, and
after that both sides would settle down to another long spell of
trench warfare. It was folly to talk, as the newspapers were
doing, of a decisive battle.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span></p>

<p>When day broke on the 21st of March, however, it was clear
that there had been some truth in the “big battle” rumours,
for the first day of spring was heralded by such an intense enemy
bombardment that there was no longer any doubt that the
Bosche was making a supreme effort, beside which all his previous
attacks faded into insignificance.</p>

<p>The difficulty at first was to find out where the attack was
being pushed home, for in spite of the bombardment, which lasted
from 4.30 a.m. until 11.0 a.m., there was no infantry engagement
on the 21st of March on the 140th Brigade front. It was fortunate,
too, that this was so, for the gas shells fell so freely all
around that box respirators had to be worn continuously for
six and a half hours.</p>

<p>There have been many attempts to write the story of the
great retreat and, generally speaking, the experience of one
battalion was much the same as that of any other. But it
is well-nigh impossible to describe in detail the career of any
unit throughout the most strenuous days of the fighting&mdash;the
21st to the 26th of March. During these days battalions
often became split up into several parties engaged in different
small fights, where none knew how the battle fared with their
comrades in other parts of the field. The war correspondents,
it is true, saw the Allied troops fighting every inch of ground,
and killing thousands of Germans as they fell back, but it was
difficult indeed for those engaged in the fighting to ascertain
what the situation was, and a total lack of information was one
of the outstanding features of the retreat. It was only when
they ultimately got back into reserve, some days after, that the
troops were able to learn from the newspapers that the Germans
had been badly beaten all along the line. “Still,” thought the
British Tommy, who had marched in six days across country
covered by two ordnance maps, “I don’t altogether like this
new style of winning the war.”</p>

<p>The story of the Civil Service Rifles during these critical
days of their career in France is told briefly in the official War
Diary, which contains just a simple record of their movements
without any comment.</p>

<p>In that record it is told how the Battalion, which was in support
in Lincoln Reserve on the morning of the 21st, became at night
the front line battalion, the 17th and 18th Battalions having
been withdrawn. The second day of the battle was quiet on
the Civil Service Rifles’ front, and the Battalion remained undisturbed
in Lincoln Reserve until the early hours of the 23rd,
when, orders having been received to withdraw, a position was
taken up on the Dessart Ridge Switch, on the right of the Metz-Fins
Road. The line was complete by dawn, the dispositions
being “A” Company on the left, with their left flank on the road
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
and their right in touch with “B,” with “C” and “D” on the
right of “B”: Battalion Headquarters was established in a
bank about half a mile behind. “A” was afterwards, owing
to congestion, withdrawn to a position slightly in rear of the
two companies.</p>

<div id="i179" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i179.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Sketch illustrating the First Day of the C.S.R. Retreat&mdash;23 March 1918.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The 23rd of March was the most critical day in the career of
the Civil Service Rifles in France. The official narrative disposes
of it in less than a page, but a whole book could be written on
the many situations which arose on that day, and the many acts
of heroism, determination and devotion to duty performed by
different members of the Battalion.</p>

<p>The story of the fighting can be followed more or less from
the map on the opposite page.</p>

<p>Immediately the position on Dessart Ridge Switch was taken
up, i.e., about 5.0 a.m., “D” Company on the right became
engaged with the enemy, who attempted to rush in from the
right flank, which was unprotected, and by 7.0 a.m. the Battalion
was engaging the enemy all along the line. At 8.0 a.m. the
enemy made a determined bombing attack on the right of “D”
Company, and established machine gun posts which enfiladed
the position. Shortly afterwards large numbers of troops were
seen to be retiring, apparently from the position known as Metz
Switch. Colonel Segrave went over and rallied these, and took
them forward with his Headquarters Company to the ridge
between Metz and Dessart Wood (east of the Metz-Fins Road),
and took up a position facing east, and at right angles to the
Dessart Switch line. This was done to form a rallying line for
retiring troops and a defensive flank to Dessart Ridge Switch.</p>

<p>After shelling the whole area for an hour or two more, the
enemy gained a little more ground and established further
machine-gun posts, this time towards the left, south and south-east
of Metz. Shortly after noon, troops on the left retired,
leaving the left flank of the Civil Service Rifles exposed, and
the Battalion now held an isolated position with the enemy
working his way round both flanks. The Headquarters Company
was accordingly withdrawn to the Vallulart Wood Line,
and the remaining Companies, in the Dessart Switch Line facing
South, continued the fight in the same position, forming a
flank to what had been the third British system of defensive
positions, now occupied by some Civil Service Rifles and other
troops.</p>

<p>This third system and the Dessart Switch Line were abandoned
at about 4.0 p.m., but “D” Company on the right had
by this time been surrounded and was never extricated. The
cause of this disaster was the fact that the Company’s right
flank was completely “in the air” from the time it reached
the position. Indeed, this may be said of every position the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
Battalion took up during the day. There was not at any time
any support on the right flank, the troops of the 9th Division
(5th Army) having already departed before the fighting began.
Many explanations of these repeated withdrawals have since
been made, both in after-dinner speeches and in statements
to the Press. At least one book has been written on the subject.
There was, and apparently still is, considerable difference of
opinion as to the justification for the action of the troops of
the 5th Army. This story is not concerned with the controversy.
The statement is made simply to illustrate how the
Civil Service Rifles, on the right of the 47th Division, felt the
full effect of the rapid withdrawal of the troops on their right.</p>

<div id="i181" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i181.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Sketch illustrating the Second Day of the C.S.R. Retreat (24 March 1918) and also the Fighting at High Wood and Eaucourt L’Abbe in September and October 1916.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The movements of the various parts of the Battalion after
4.0 p.m. on the 23rd are not even now very clear. Battalion
Headquarters (less Headquarters Company) left the third
system at 4.0 p.m. and moved to Rocquigny, when Colonel
Segrave collected a party of about fifty and put them in position
along a ridge north of Four Winds Farm, about a mile and a
half south-west of Ytres, where they remained until the enemy
drove them out at dusk.</p>

<p>At this point the official narrative breaks down with the
remark: “By this time the remnants of the Civil Service Rifles
were split up into so many parties, whose movements are too
complicated to follow.” The survivors from those small parties,
remembering their night of wandering in the dark over rough
and strange country, and their inexplicable reunion at dawn,
will bear out the truth of the last sentence.</p>

<p>By 9.0 a.m. on the twenty-fourth, the Battalion had been
reduced to a mere handful of troops, who were worn out by their
twenty-four hours’ continuous fighting. The fate of the majority
of the absentees was only too well known, but there
were a good many missing whose fate was uncertain. The
survivors, however, gallantly stuck to their task, and, numbering
about 150, they took up a position under Colonel Segrave,
just east of the Bapaume-Peronne road, and about a mile south-east
of Le Transloy. Here they remained in support of a party
of the 1st Surrey Rifles holding the higher ground to the east,
until at noon they had to move back another two miles almost
due west, and a position was taken up about half a mile south
of Le Transloy and just off the western side of the Le Transloy-Combles
road. This position was only held for three hours,
when the party, now acting as a rearguard, moved round the
western side of Le Transloy to a line north-east of Gueudecourt,
whence they were withdrawn at 5.30 p.m. by order of the Brigade
Commander through Gueudecourt and Flers to Martinpuich.</p>

<p>It was still light when Martinpuich was reached, and there
were a few of the 150 or so survivors to whom the sight of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
ruins of Eaucourt L’Abb&eacute; and the Flers Line recalled their grim
struggle of October 1916. It was by no means a happy coincidence
that brought the Civil Service Rifles back to this
battlefield, where, eighteen months previously, they had paid
such a price for the capture of High Wood. On their previous
visit to this area they had been filled with confidence and the
offensive spirit. They had felt they were really doing something
towards winning the war. To retreat across the same country
now made it seem as though all the labours of the past eighteen
months had been wasted&mdash;the lives lost in vain. It had been
better if this battlefield had not been reached until darkness
had fallen, and perhaps spared those men the bitter reflections
on the autumn of 1916 and all they had gone through since.</p>

<p>There was little time, however, for reminiscences, for only a
very short stay was made in Martinpuich, and 10.0 p.m. found
the Battalion reforming at Bazentin-le-Petit, where further
officers and other ranks rejoining brought the strength up to
about 230 all ranks. An outpost position was then taken up
along the eastern edge of Bazentin-le-Petit and occupied until
10.0 a.m. on the 25th, when a withdrawal was made to Contalmaison
Ridge, where the Battalion remained until 3.0 a.m.
on the 26th.</p>

<p>After the rapid changes of position during the past two days
it had seemed quite a long stay on Contalmaison Ridge, but
the troops were not destined to settle there, and the next move
was to Bouzincourt. The fighting had now ceased for the
time being, so far, at least, as the Civil Service Rifles were
concerned, but there was still no rest to be had, and it was not
until after a five hours’ march via Contalmaison, La Boiselle
and thence across country to Aveluy and Bouzincourt, that
billets were reached. The Battalion was now supposed to be
resting, but after eight hours in Bouzincourt, the men were
on the march again, and at 4.0 p.m. on the 26th they trudged
along to billets at Louvencourt, where the night was spent.</p>

<p>At 9.0 a.m. on the 27th the march was resumed and after a
rest for an hour or two at Clairfaye Farm, a move was made
to billets at Toutencourt, where a halt was made for quite
twelve hours!</p>

<p>During these marches the Battalion had been in reserve,
but now it began to move back to the front line, but before
relieving the 6th Buffs (12th Division) in Aveluy Wood on the
night of the 29th, a very welcome twenty-four hours’ rest had
been enjoyed in billets at Warloy.</p>

<p>While the fighting portion of the Battalion had been having
such a strenuous time in the retreat, the Administrative portion
had also had plenty of excitement, and the men of the transport
section and Quartermaster’s staff had frequently had to think
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
about knocking the ashes out of their rifles and sharpening
their bayonets during days when they were often in touch with
the enemy. For a time they had to carry on as a separate unit,
and the story of their travels is told in the following narrative
contributed by Transport-Sergeant G. M. Sladden, to whom
much credit is due for the withdrawal of the Regimental transport
without the loss of a man or a horse.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The period of the ‘Great Retreat’ was an arduous one for the
Battalion Transport, entailing conditions vastly different from the
ordered routine incidental to trench warfare. Their lines were
stationed on the 21st March in a field on the Metz-Fins road, the
Quartermaster’s stores being then in Metz, where the Battalion had
been billeted prior to relieving the 2nd Division in the line. The
stores were filled with an unusually heavy stock of material, including
the blankets of the Battalion, the officers’ valises and the men’s
packs. In fact, mobile conditions did not exist at this time.</p>

<p>“Early on the morning of the 22nd the hostile attack developed
on our part of the front, and it rapidly became apparent that the
attack was making headway, though hitherto no news had been
heard of the great German success on the previous day further
south. To the right was seen an aerial attack in great force on the
9th Division, of which some details soon began to pass in retreat by
the transport lines. The officers’ mess cart, which had gone early
to Nurlu canteen, returned to report the canteen shelled out and
Nurlu deserted. Soon orders arrived that the Battalion was to
retire after nightfall to the Dessart Switch line, and the Transport to
withdraw to Bus. Accordingly, all wagons not required to take up
rations and move the Battalion that night were sent off at once with
loads to Bus, and orders to return for a second load as soon as
possible. Blankets were sent first, valises were left for the second
journey: but the congested state of the roads and the rapidity of
the enemy advance upset all calculations. The A.S.C. wagons,
which were to have cleared the Quartermaster stores, were prevented
by the road controls from returning to Metz. Consequently,
there are certain officers who cherish regretful memories of persistent
but futile efforts to induce a harsh War Office to compensate
them for the loss of valuable but non-regulation articles of kit.
Some of the limbered wagons&mdash;luckier or perhaps swifter than the
A.S.C. motors&mdash;got back to the Transport lines late that night
and picked up second loads. They were none too soon, for as
they finished loading they were fired upon by machine guns from
a patrol which had reached the ridge overlooking the lines from a
few hundred yards away. The wagons, luckily, were standing in a
sunken road and down this they were able to escape without casualty.
Meanwhile, the ration wagons had gone up to the line, where they
found the front line now withdrawn to the support line and preparing
to evacuate the position. Ammunition dumps&mdash;notably the great
dump at Trescault&mdash;were being blown up all round: indications
of a big retreat abounded. Having delivered rations, the column
waited to pick up Lewis guns and other equipment, and to take
them back to the new position. Gradually the guns came down
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
until all but one had arrived; the Battalion was clear and platoons
of other Battalions continued to file by&mdash;still no Lewis gun. Yet
orders were definite, to wait till all the guns had come. But when
the last platoon of the last Battalion had passed, it seemed certain
that the missing gun must have gone some other way. The boy
who stood on the burning deck was doubtless noble but certainly
idiotic: moreover, it seemed possible that the fifteen guns on the
wagons <i>might</i> be wanted. So orders were stoutly disobeyed and
away went the wagons. They had been warned not to go back by
the route by which they had come up, which had been reported
occupied by the enemy; so in the blackness of a pitch-dark night,
over unreconnoitred ground, they made a bee-line for the road
between Metz and Trescault.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Over hill, over dale,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through bush, through briar,<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>and hit it at last, though once nearly ingulfed in a bog. And so
up the Fins road to the appointed place, where everything was
safely handed over. The next stage was to the Transport lines,
where the trekking loads of the wagons were waiting to be picked
up; but, at a short distance from the lines, bullets coming from that
direction made it appear probable that the enemy was in possession,
and this was confirmed by the Battalion Intelligence Officer who
happened to meet the column at this juncture. Nothing for it then
but to get away and join up with the rest of the Transport at Bus.</p>

<p>“At Bus the whole of the Brigade Transport was standing by
waiting orders to move; so the tired horses could not even be
unharnessed. There was, however, opportunity to water and feed
both for horse and man before a move was made, which was not
actually until midday. The line of march was by Le Mesnil and
Saillisel to Le Transloy, over by roads much cut up. At one point
the column had to pass over a quaking bog, of which the thin crust
had to be continually reinforced, after the passage at the gallop
of each vehicle, with fascines, bits of plank, and anything that came
handy. The prevailing fine weather was a god send; without it
the column could not have passed this spot. Night had fallen before
the column pulled off the road on to a shell-riddled stretch of the old
Somme battlefield where wagons and horses could only stand
higgledy-piggledy wherever a spot without a shell-hole could be
found. Here the A.S.C. supply wagons were waiting, and at once
rations were loaded on the limbers and sent off to find the Battalion.
This was successfully done, and meanwhile the remaining horses and
men were able to snatch a little sleep, though standing by to move
at ten minutes’ notice. Orders were hourly expected, for the front
line was falling back fast, and shortly before midnight part of it&mdash;in
the shape of ‘A’ Company, which had lost touch&mdash;drifted into
the lines in search of the rest of the Battalion. After they had
pushed forward again to take up a defensive position it was found
that other units of the Brigade Transport had moved off. Assuming
that orders had miscarried (as afterwards was found to be the case),
and knowing that if the column was to get away at all, it must be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
before dawn, a move was made without orders. It was found
afterwards that the rest of the Brigade marched via Les Boeufs,
where they had some casualties through shell fire; so the choice of
route of the 15th via Saillisel and Combles was a lucky one, for
the column was unmolested on this road except by a little heavy
shrapnel that did no harm. Some trouble was caused at Saillisel,
where, just as dawn began to break, and with the enemy on a ridge
only a short distance away, the road was found to be blocked by
part of an ammunition column. After some difficulty they were
passed&mdash;another stroke of luck, for it was heard afterwards that
this column failed to get away. Combles, too, was found to contain
the Divisional Ordnance Depot, where all stores were being destroyed.
A few men were able as they passed to snatch articles of kit that
they had lost: the Battalion saddler still mourns over his failure to
‘scrounge’ a complete saddler’s outfit. He found it too heavy to
catch the last wagon and stow it there.</p>

<p>“It took a weary while to reach Bazentin Le Petit that day, for
after Ginchy the road was congested with an enormous mass of
traffic. However, it was done, and horses and men, utterly weary
hoped for a little rest there. But it seemed that the march would
never end, for orders came for the retreat to continue; and at dusk
all (except enough cookers and ration wagons to supply the Battalion
with food that night) moved off via Albert to a new halting ground.
During the afternoon a slight diversion had been caused by several
enemy aeroplanes that came over and dropped a few bombs intended
for the Brigade Transport; it was, however, a very timid raid of the
tip-and-run variety and did no harm. Of a very different kind was
the relay raid that the column passing through Albert that night
experienced. From dark to light a succession of machines dropped
bombs up and down the main street of Albert and the main roads
approaching the town. The street was full of moving traffic, and
things were made much worse by many motor transport drivers
leaving their lorries standing and taking cover in houses. It seemed
at one time as if the column of the 140th Brigade would be utterly
unable to go forward; but the acting Transport Officer and Quartermaster,
Lieutenant A. L. Mills, did excellent work in sorting out the
disorganised mass of vehicles ahead, and the Brigade column finally
got through with far fewer casualties than might have been expected,
and of these the 15th incurred none. Meanwhile the ration column
had set out with an escort of armoured cars to meet the Battalion
at Bazentin Le Grand. The Battalion was, for the moment, not
holding a position, and it was possible to give every man the good,
hot meal of which he stood in need. The escort proved unnecessary,
and as it was growing light when Albert was passed on the return
journey, the ration column escaped the bombing that the others had
undergone. But the bodies and the wreckage showed them how
much Albert had suffered that night. They rejoined the rest of the
transport in the small hours of the morning of the 25th, but within
four hours the whole column was on the move again to just outside
Millencourt. Here was another short halt, during which the 15th
acquired two ‘buckshee’ horses&mdash;one of them an excellent animal,
who served them well until he was killed six months later, the other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
blind and vicious: it was easy to guess how he came to be roving
free&mdash;and he was soon given his freedom back again. Tired though
every man and beast was, it was necessary to move again that
afternoon, because the unit was said to be on the wrong side of
road. They were sent to a pitch which was also useless because
too soft for wagon or horse lines&mdash;involving another move, unauthorised
this time. Rations went up as soon as the third move
had been carried out, and after a long wait at the rendezvous were
sent back to the lines, for the Battalion was at last coming out of the
line. The ration column got back to the lines just in time to move
with the rest of the Transport to Bouzincourt, where the relieved
Battalion was met early on the morning of the 26th. From which
time for a while the history of the movements of the Transport
merges again with that of the Battalion as a whole.</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A second phase of the fighting opened when the Battalion
moved to Aveluy Wood on the night of the 29th of March.</p>

<p>There had been no time for a proper re-organisation, and
the troops had not yet recovered from their exertions during
the retreat. The casualties since the morning of the 21st of
March numbered no less than 350 (all ranks) and as no reinforcements
had joined, it was as well that the second phase opened
quietly.</p>

<p>One and a half companies occupied an outpost position in
Aveluy Wood, and the remainder of the Battalion was in a
ravine 800 yards south of Martinsart. The 22nd Battalion was
on the left, with a gap of 400 yards between the two units. For
three days this position was held, and except for hostile shelling
there was little enemy activity, the casualties for the three
days numbering little more than a dozen. The 20th Battalion
on the night of the 1st of April, relieved the Civil Service Rifles,
who moved into billets in Senlis, and after two days’ rest and
a more than welcome bath, the Battalion, now somewhat reorganised,
returned to the front line and relieved the 1st Surrey
Rifles on the night of the 4th of April. “A” Company held
the right, “C” the centre, and a company of the 1st Surrey
Rifles, who were attached, held the left. “B” and “D” Companies
were in support and Battalion Headquarters was in
Bouzincourt. The 9th Royal Fusiliers (12th Division) were
on the right of the Civil Service Rifles and the 142nd Brigade
on the left.</p>

<p>The few reinforcements who had joined included Major L. L.
Pargiter, of the Middlesex Regiment, who came to the Battalion
on the 4th of April as second in command.</p>

<p>Such were the dispositions when the battle for Aveluy Wood
opened on the morning of the 5th of April.</p>

<p>As usual, the enemy opened with a heavy bombardment on
the front line, support trenches, and Bouzincourt, gas shells
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
being freely mixed with the heavier missiles. The bombardment
began at 7.0 a.m. and except for three short intervals of
about half an hour each, it continued until 4.30 p.m. Throughout
the afternoon the bombardment of Bouzincourt was particularly
intense. The enemy was excellently supported by
his machine guns, which were active all day on the front line
and support trenches with both direct and indirect fire.</p>

<p>When the bombardment began the enemy could be seen
along the crest opposite the front line in twos and threes (total
about 150). These small groups were dispersed by rifle fire,
but at about 10.0 a.m. small groups again began to dribble
forward over the crest, and these advanced in spite of Lewis
gun and rifle fire, by using the cover afforded by huts and sheds,
until they reached the trees and broken ground on the outskirts
of Aveluy Wood. It is estimated that roughly 300 of the
enemy with light machine guns pushed forward in this way.
The front line held by the Civil Service Rifles was by this time
enfiladed with machine-gun fire and minenwerfers, and under
cover of this fire the parties in the broken ground crept forward
to within 100 yards of the British front line. These parties
showed up several times as if about to rush the position, but
whenever they appeared, Lewis gun and rifle fire kept them
back, and the intended assault was not delivered.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the enemy was seen to be digging in on the
crest from which he had doubled forward earlier in the day,
and by 6.0 p.m. this ground was effectually swept by artillery
fire, with the result that no further signs of an advance were
seen at that point.</p>

<p>By nightfall the enemy appeared to give up the attempt,
at all events for that day, and the situation became considerably
quieter. “D” Company now relieved the attached Company
of the 1st Surrey Rifles in the front line, and this latter Company
moved into support. The casualties in the Civil Service Rifles
numbered fifty (all ranks), including Colonel Segrave, who was
slightly gassed, and who was sent to the transport lines for a
well-earned rest, Major Pargiter taking command of the Battalion.</p>

<p>The 6th of April was a day of alarms, but although small
parties of the enemy were detected in the early morning moving
forward under cover of the mist, there was no real infantry
engagement. The snipers were busy on both sides and those
of the Civil Service Rifles got many targets, and one of the
enemy was captured after being wounded.</p>

<p>Intermittent bombardments were the feature of the day,
but the battle died down for good after 10.0 p.m. with the Germans
really well held, and with this night came to an end the
fighting in the great Retreat on this front, and the Bosche thereafter
did not gain any ground at all.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>

<p>After holding the line for one more day, which was fairly quiet,
the Battalion was relieved on the night of the 7th of April by
the 17th and 21st Battalions, and marched to billets in Senlis.
It was not yet known that the Division was about to move
back to a training area, but the rumour soon began to get round
to that effect, and the prospect of a real rest acted as a splendid
tonic to the weary survivors of the darkest days in the history
of the Division. They had been dark days, indeed, but those
who came through could look back on them with satisfaction in
the knowledge that their Battalion had played its part nobly
during a period when a trip to Germany&mdash;or elsewhere&mdash;had
often seemed to be the most probable end to their career in
France.</p>

<p>This story of the movements of the 1st Civil Service Rifles
during the Retreat is based on the official narrative written by
Battalion Headquarters, but it should be borne in mind that
the fighting during the last days of March was of so extraordinary
a character that the description here given will fall very far short
of the affair as it appeared to many of the members of the Battalion.
Only those who took part in it will be able to realise
the difficulty of describing a series of actions in which the
Battalion was split up into several different bodies, each fighting
battles of their own, with little or no knowledge of the whereabouts
of their comrades. If this feature of the fighting is considered,
it will help to explain why so many of the casualties
were reported as “wounded and missing” or “missing, believed
killed” without any definite information as to the place where
they occurred.</p>

<p>The casualties among officers, warrant officers and N.C.O.’s
were very heavy, but these serve to emphasise the splendid spirit
of the men. Nothing could illustrate their excellent discipline,
determination and fighting qualities more forcibly than that
assembly at Bazentin le Petit on the night of the 24th of March.
In spite of being cut off from their comrades these several small
parties had carried on the fight for more than twenty-four hours&mdash;often
without even a Lance-corporal in charge&mdash;and the
simple statement that “10.0 p.m. saw the Battalion reforming
at Bazentin le Petit” is in reality a record of the finest achievement
of the men of the 1st Civil Service Rifles during the war.</p>

<p>A good many of the N.C.O.’s and men were decorated for
their work during the Retreat, but every one of those 230 all ranks
who refused to be beaten on the 23rd and 24th of March, 1918,
is deserving of the highest praise. It would have been some
small recognition of their great gallantry and devotion to duty
if the names of these men could have been inscribed on a special
Roll of Honour.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br />

<span class="medium">MONTHS OF “WIND UP”</span></h2>

<p>One night in Senlis was followed by a night in Hedauville,
and then on the 9th of April, after a march to Acheux, the Battalion
was conveyed by buses to the back area. The bus
journey was pleasant enough at first, but on arriving at Beauval,
where the troops were to have been billeted, it was found that
all the accommodation had been allotted to other troops.</p>

<p>The bus column halted in the main road outside the village
where a draft of 600 other ranks was waiting to join the
Battalion. The draft had been waiting by the roadside since
noon, and the men had had both dinner and tea in the same
spot. But soon after dark the draft received orders to march
to the next village, Gezaincourt, the Battalion continuing the
journey by bus. The speed of the buses can best be judged
by the fact that the draft arrived at Gezaincourt&mdash;about three
and a half miles away&mdash;more than an hour in front of the
Battalion.</p>

<p>The next day at Gezaincourt was spent in re-organising Companies
and sorting out the huge draft, which was found to contain
parties from practically every Battalion of the London
Regiment except the Artists and the Scottish. The Civil Service
Riflemen were now in a minority in their own Regiment.</p>

<p>The journey was continued on the 11th of April, when the
Battalion marched to Domart en Ponthieu, a delightful village,
where all ranks would have been happy to remain for the rest
of the war. But it was not to be, for the troops were on the
move again early next day, and after a fifteen miles’ march the
training area was reached, and the Civil Service Rifles were
billeted in the village of Canchy, close to the historic forest of
Crecy. The village was also occupied by Divisional Headquarters,
and the billets allotted to the Battalion were consequently
poor, everything worth having being appropriated
for the use of Divisional Headquarters.</p>

<p>The usual training programme was carried out and drafts
continued to arrive until the Battalion grew to an unwieldy
size, being over 1,300 strong. But although numerically it
was stronger than it had ever been, the vast majority of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
men were very raw&mdash;recruits who had been hurried out during
the panic caused by the Retreat. It was soon found that the
Civil Service Rifles had received more than their share of these
men, and 250 of them were accordingly sent to the 142nd
Brigade.</p>

<p>The only breaks in the routine of training were trips to
Abbeville, football matches, and a half-hearted sort of Sports
Meeting.</p>

<p>The Divisional Commander visited the Brigade at a Brigade
parade at Forest l’Abbaye, on the 18th of April, when he complimented
the Brigade on its work during recent operations,
and hinted darkly at further “dirty work” in store in the
near future.</p>

<p>The concluding sporting event at Canchy was a football
match against the Divisional Train, the holders of the Divisional
Company, who were well beaten by four goals to nil. While
the match was in progress orders were received for the Transport
to move early the next day, Sunday, the 28th of April, and for
the Battalion to move by bus on Monday morning.</p>

<p>Although the programme of training had been arranged for
another week, the sudden orders to move occasioned little surprise,
for it was quite a common thing for a “training holiday”
to be cut short, and the Transport Section accordingly moved
to St. Quen without any fuss.</p>

<p>On the last afternoon at Canchy the <i>entente cordiale</i> between
the Civil Service Rifles and the villagers was strengthened by a
tea-party which Colonel Segrave gave to the village children.
To entertain them were engaged the Divisional Cinema, the
String Trio and Private Saipe. The latter’s conjuring brought
down the house, and was so popular that the conjurer, on taking
his evening stroll later on, was mobbed by the villagers, who
insisted on his giving them a “second house” in the open air.</p>

<p>The bus journey to Contay was uneventful, and on leaving
the buses, the Battalion, just over 700 strong, marched to
billets in Warloy. A battle surplus of eight officers and 240
other ranks had been left behind at a Divisional Reinforcement
Camp at Estr&eacute;es les Crecy.</p>

<p>The German advance had been held up in the neighbourhood
of Albert, and for some weeks now no move had been made on
either side, though farther north the allied lines in the Ypres
and Armentieres districts had been pushed back considerably.
It was not, therefore, surprising when the 21st Australian
Battalion was relieved on the night of the 1st of May outside
the Albert-Amiens Road that orders were issued to all units
to make every possible preparation to meet an enemy attack,
which, to use the official language, “is likely to develop on our
front in the near future.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span></p>

<p>During this tour of the trenches the patrols of “B,” “C,”
and “D” Companies, who were the three front line Companies,
all reported that at 2.0 a.m. on the morning of the 4th of May,
a noise resembling that of steam tractors was heard coming
from the vicinity of the railway south of the Albert Road.
As a result, the R.A.F. carried out a special reconnaissance at
dawn and found four enemy tanks hiding near the railway.
These were bombed, two being totally destroyed and the others
disabled. The Brigadier General specially commended the
Civil Service Rifles on the good work done by the patrols.</p>

<p>The discovery of the tanks, however, only served to increase
the warnings of a coming attack, and an otherwise uneventful
spell in the mud and water was frequently disturbed by such
orders from Division as “See that all men have a hot meal
immediately: Attack probable this morning.”</p>

<p>On the night of the 6th of May a somewhat complicated relief,
owing to a reshuffle of Brigades on the Corps front, brought to
an end a surprisingly peaceful stay in the front line. It did not,
however, bring much comfort to the troops.</p>

<p>The Battalion was to move back to support trenches in the
neighbourhood of Millencourt and Henencourt, but the Companies
had the greatest difficulty in identifying their positions,
as they turned out to be mere scratches in the ground. The
night was black and the rain poured in torrents throughout.
The relief was accordingly exceptionally slow and day was
breaking ere the support positions were reached.</p>

<p>The Officer Commanding “A” Company found in Millencourt
some unoccupied cellars with plenty of straw, and decided to
stow his men away there and risk the consequences. “B” and
“C” Companies found ruined houses in Henencourt, and “D”
moved into a barn in the yard of the ch&acirc;teau at Henencourt,
which had been Third Corps Headquarters during the Somme
battle of 1916. Battalion Headquarters was at the Grand
Caporal estaminet&mdash;a “house” that had been a favourite
resort of the men of the Civil Service Rifles during the rest after
High Wood in 1916. But how the village had changed since
those days! In 1916 Henencourt had been a tolerably clean
inhabited village, but now all was desolation, every house was
in ruins, and there was not a civilian to be found anywhere.</p>

<p>By night the Companies occupied their battle positions and
tried to dig trenches there, and by day they kept under cover
in their billets. A search was made for bath tubs, and a bath-house
was started in the Ch&acirc;teau yard, and apart from occasional
shelling of Millencourt and Henencourt, a fairly comfortable
time was spent in these villages.</p>

<p>The next visit to the front line was to relieve the 17th London
Regiment astride the Millencourt-Albert Road, a mile or so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
east of the village of Millencourt. The trenches here were new,
and so exposed that no cooking could be done there. All food
was cooked at the Quartermaster’s stores at Warloy and brought
up at night, when the troops had their only hot meal of the day.
The tea was sent up in petrol cans enclosed in packs stuffed with
hay&mdash;a method which had been adopted by members of the
Transport Section some months previously for keeping tea hot
on a long march.</p>

<p>Digging new trenches and wiring were the nightly tasks of
all Companies during five uneventful days in this sector, and
on relief by the 6th London Regiment&mdash;now in the 58th Division&mdash;the
Battalion moved back to billets in Warloy, and on the
following day the Division moved into Corps Reserve.</p>

<p>The period in Corps Reserve had generally been spent in
tolerably comfortable billets in inhabited villages some distance
from the firing line, but on this occasion the Division was kept
close up, owing to the possibility of an enemy attack, and it
fell to the lot of the 140th Brigade to occupy small woods in the
neighbourhood of Warloy and Bazieux. The accommodation
was distinctly poor, the men having to sleep under bivouac
sheets&mdash;or trench shelters as they were called officially.</p>

<p>Colonel Segrave accordingly indulged in a little billeting on
his own account and fixed his battalion up in comfortable billets
in Warloy, observing at the same time that as they were nearer
to the front line they were tactically in a better position to meet
an emergency. A wordy warfare with the Divisional Staff
ensued, and for a few days the Civil Service Rifles hung on to
their billets, although the Colonel had been withdrawn to command
the 141st Brigade. But soon a move had to be made to
the bivouacs in the Bois La Haut, north of Bazieux, where the
days were spent by the troops in digging cable trenches near
Henencourt Wood, and the nights were often spent in alarms
and standing to.</p>

<p>Indeed, a more restless period in Corps Reserve had never
been known. All officers were taken to reconnoitre positions
of assembly for counter-attack, and to each battalion in the
Brigade was allotted a definite objective. It was announced
that the attack would be launched on the 20th, and the officers
were taken through a kind of rehearsal of their counter-attack.</p>

<p>Nightly bombing raids by enemy aeroplanes added to the
discomfort, and on the night of the 18th of May an intense
bombardment was heard. Later, an alarm was sounded in an
adjacent wood, and the Battalion stood to arms at 2.0 a.m. and
remained so for about an hour. Thereafter the troops were
made to stand to arms each morning at an hour before dawn as
in the trenches, and the cooks had to “keep up steam” in
readiness to serve a hot meal at once in the event of an enemy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
attack on the Corps front. Happily nothing so unpleasant as
an attack developed, but the camp was shelled on the morning
of the 22nd, with the result that the Transport Section lost an
old and tried friend in Corporal Banks, who had been with them
continuously since mobilisation. It was cruel luck that he
should be killed while in Corps Reserve, after surviving such
ordeals as the Somme, Ypres Salient, Bourlon Wood and the
Retreat. Two horses were also killed and two others wounded.</p>

<p>The Division moved out of Corps Reserve on the 24th of May,
and after a whole day spent in cable burying in the pouring rain,
the Civil Service Rifles relieved the 7th East Surrey Regiment
in quarries near the Franvillers-Albert road. Here the troops
bivouacked amongst guns and howitzers of all calibres; in some
cases the men slept, or rather spent the night, under the muzzles
of the guns. The only good thing the Battalion got out of this
relief was a draft of 10 N.C.O.’s, who had been wounded on
the Somme in 1916, and on their return to France had been
drafted to the East Surrey Regiment. By a strange coincidence
they rejoined the Civil Service Rifles almost on the very ground
where they had been trained for the Somme battle, for the
Bois Robert, where many of the rehearsals for High Wood took
place, was within a hundred yards or so of the bivouacs.</p>

<p>A short stay amid the guns was followed by a move to comfortable
but shell-riddled billets in Baizieux&mdash;a village somewhat
changed since the previous Christmas, when it was occupied by
Divisional Headquarters.</p>

<p>The 4th Battalion Royal Welsh Fusiliers was relieved in the
Lavieville defences on the 26th of May, and here the Battalion
spent four days in support trenches, during the whole of which
time all Companies were at work with the Royal Engineers on
cable burying. At the end of May 1918, the Civil Service Rifles
occupied a field surrounded by new and shallow trenches just
north of the Franvillers-Berhencourt road, and about half a
mile west of Franvillers itself. These trenches were the rear
defences of the Lahoussoye system, but the men occupied tents
and bivouacs outside the trenches.</p>

<p>There followed five uneventful days in the front line opposite
the village of Dernancourt, and on relief by the 17th Battalion
on the night of the 6th of June, support trenches astride the
Albert-Amiens road were occupied for three days. The Battalion
then relieved the 1st Surrey Rifles in the front line on the
immediate left of the sector held previously. This particular
area was held by the Brigade for nearly three weeks, the
Battalion changing round every four or five days. Nothing
worthy of note happened until, on the 19th of June, the Division
was relieved by the 58th Division, the 6th London Regiment
taking over from the Civil Service Rifles, who had a long march
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
back to the village of Berhencourt, which was reached at about
5 a.m. After a few hours’ rest the march was continued to
Molliens au Bois, where a tented camp in a sea of mud was taken
over from the Queen Victoria Rifles. Here the Regimental
Brass Band, which had been entertaining the Commander-in-Chief
at General Headquarters for the past six weeks, rejoined,
together with the battle surplus and a draft of reinforcements
from the Divisional Reinforcement Camp.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br />

<span class="medium">INTENSIVE TRAINING</span></h2>

<p>Fortunately only one day was spent at Molliens au Bois,
and on the 21st of June a bus ride took the Civil Service Rifles
through Amiens and then round the country for a few hours,
and back to Ferrieres, a little village about four miles from
Amiens. The Battalion then marched to Guignemicourt, a
village without any water supply, a real old-fashioned out-of-the-way
country place, which seemed miles away from the war.
The big ch&acirc;teau occupied by Battalion Headquarters was the
property of a French “nouveau riche,” who, according to the
natives, had made his fortune out of beer. He had fled hurriedly
during the German advance, leaving all his furniture behind him,
but no trace could be found of the commodity which was alleged
to have earned him his francs.</p>

<p>A quaint feature of the village life was the town crier with his
drum, who took up his stand in front of the sentry outside
Battalion Headquarters and made such announcements as the
fixed price of coal, flour, etc., for the ensuing month. His
services were utilised by the Civil Service Rifles at the end of
their stay to announce to the villagers that any claims against
the Battalion must be lodged at the orderly room before the
Battalion left the village.</p>

<p>To the members of the Civil Service Rifles who were at
Guignemicourt, however, the name does not revive memories of
an old-world village or of a quaint town crier. The memory
that is inseparable from this village is one of eternal parades.
There were not only parades for work, but also parades for play,
the Battalion, after spending the morning hard at work on the
drill ground, being marched to the football field every afternoon
to take part in compulsory football. And for officers the day’s
work was carried on after lights out; for many were the hours
spent in conferences at Battalion Headquarters long after the
men were “between the sheets” in their billets.</p>

<p>The compulsory football took the form of six-a-side games, the
sides being chosen in alphabetical order throughout each platoon
or specialist section. Every able-bodied officer, warrant officer,
N.C.O., or man, had to play, and the games were on the knock-out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
principle. Only four games could be played at a time, and
those who were not playing had to look on, but, as the weather
was beautifully fine, the troops soon tumbled to the idea of bringing
their writing-pads, with the result that when the Corps
Commander and many of the gilded staff drove up to the ground
on the afternoon of the 25th of June they found a few men playing
football and the majority of the Battalion squatting on the grass
writing letters. The final was won by a team from “B”
Company.</p>

<p>After the football competition, Major L. L. Pargiter, who was
in command of the Battalion during the absence on leave of
Colonel Segrave, introduced the game of puttocks&mdash;a game
which “caught on” at once with the Battalion. Major Pargiter
was an enthusiast for sport as well as for work, and he combined
the two on the miniature range, where shooting took place every
evening, the prizes taking the form of 10 centimes for every
bull’s-eye scored. This was apparently too easy a method of
making money, for on some evenings nobody put in an appearance
except the Officer Commanding Range and the marker.</p>

<p>The eternal parades naturally provoked a certain amount of
grousing, but none the less the Battalion had reached a very high
standard of efficiency, when Colonel Segrave returned on the
2nd of July, after a month’s absence.</p>

<p>On the next day a Divisional water carnival was held at
Picquigny, where R.Q.M.S. Hart improved on his previous
year’s success by taking the first two places in the odd craft
race. He had trained on the horse pond in the village and his
craft finished so far in front of the rest of the competitors that
many of the spectators were unaware that he was in the race
at all.</p>

<p>The Battalion won the Divisional water polo championship
with the following team: Colour-Sergeant W. S. Watts, Corporal
O. S. Wraight, and Corporal T. Byron of “B” Company,
Lance-Corporal H. G. Terry of “A” Company, and Privates
T. N. Smale, “B” Company, S. Paisley and R. Bull, Transport
Section. Other members of the Battalion who distinguished
themselves were Privates E. Manfield, who was third in the back
stroke race, and Privates F. J. Garnham, “B” Company, and
P. A. Pooley, “D” Company, who with Corporal Wraight and
Private Bull gained for the Civil Service Rifles third place in
the Divisional Relay Race. Altogether it was a good day for
the Civil Service Rifles.</p>

<p>On the following day Major General Gorringe presented
ribbons to those in the Battalion who had been awarded decorations
for their work during the Retreat.</p>

<p>A Memorial Service to Civil Servants who had fallen in the
war was held in the Ch&acirc;teau grounds on the 11th of July, at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
same hour as the service in Westminster Abbey for the same
purpose was being held.</p>

<p>The only other incidents worthy of note during the last week
at Guignemicourt were the Battalion Sports Meeting, at which
“D” Company won far more points than any other Company,
and the visit of a photographer from the French Flying Corps.
Every Company and Specialist Section and almost every platoon
was photographed, as also were the Battalion football team and
many of the horses.</p>

<p>The Battalion returned to Warloy on the 12th of July and
relieved the First Surrey Rifles in support positions on the Senlis-Henencourt
Road on the 15th.</p>

<p>On the 18th of July the welcome news was received of a
successful French counter-attack on a large scale in the Soissons
region. The news was cheering to all ranks, but no one even
suspected that this was the beginning of the end, and that in
four months’ time the Armistice would be signed.</p>

<p>On the 20th of July the 17th Battalion was relieved by the
Civil Service Rifles in front line trenches due east of Millencourt,
and a company of American Infantry of the 131st Regiment,
33rd U.S.A. Division, became attached for instruction in trench
warfare. The American troops were of fine physique and were
very keen, but what seemed to appeal to them most was the
excellent cooking of the Civil Service Rifles cooks. Many of
them declared that although they were living in trenches they
had not been fed so well since they left home.</p>

<p>Each of the four Companies of the 131st Regiment (1st
Battalion) spent twenty-four hours under instruction with the
Civil Service Rifles, and on the 24th of July, the whole of the
American Battalion became attached to the 140th Brigade and
relieved the Civil Service Rifles who moved back to Contay.
Colonel Segrave and his Adjutant, four Company Commanders
and some senior N.C.O.’s remained with the U.S.A. troops
until the following day, when all returned to Contay except
the Commanding Officer and Adjutant, who were attached to
the American Battalion for a further period of two days. In the
meantime the four Company Quartermaster Sergeants were
attached to the American Quartermaster to assist him in
rationing his Battalion while it was in the front line.</p>

<p>After five days at Contay the Civil Service Rifles relieved the
17th Battalion in support to the front line recently held, where
they were relieved on the 30th of July by the 19th Battalion,
and moved back to the positions on the Senlis-Henencourt Road,
now occupied by the forward Battalion of the Brigade in
Divisional Reserve.</p>

<p>The month of August, 1918, was certainly an eventful one, for it
brought with it a general advance on the whole of the Corps front.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span></p>

<p>There was little in the early days of the month to suggest the
startling changes that were to come over the military situation
in the immediate vicinity of the 47th Divisional front, though as
time went on, the news of advances in various parts of the
allied line revived an enthusiasm that had perhaps been on the
wane since the beginning of the year.</p>

<p>There was as yet no talk of a coming attack by the 140th
Brigade, and on the night of the 5th of August, after spending
two days in Warloy, the Civil Service Rifles relieved the 24th
Battalion on the right of the Divisional front, just outside Albert
on the Amiens Road. But although there had been no special
preparation for an attack, it was thought quite likely that one
might soon be made, as the enemy had withdrawn his line from
the position round Albert, and even from the town itself it was
believed.</p>

<p>“B” Company occupied parts of the two old German front
lines, and had sentry groups also along the west side of the
railway embankment overlooking the River Ancre. It appeared
to be quite true that the Germans had withdrawn, for no trace of
one was seen on the Battalion front.</p>

<p>On the 6th of August news was received that Colonel Segrave,
who was at the time Acting Brigade Commander, had been
promoted to the rank of Brigadier General, and he left forthwith
to command the 152nd Brigade in the 51st Division, and the
Civil Service Rifles had to part for good with one who had been
to them something far more than a Commanding Officer.</p>

<p>Although Colonel Segrave’s promotion had been more or less
expected for some time, he received very short notice to depart,
and was not even given an opportunity to say good-bye. It is
difficult to say whether he or the Battalion felt the parting
more keenly, for he was loved by those whom he commanded
as much as he loved them&mdash;which is saying a great deal.</p>

<p>No story of the 1st Civil Service Rifles can be complete without
an appreciation of one who is regarded by all who served under
him as the finest Commanding Officer the Regiment ever had.
His gallantry in the field has already been referred to, and it
was fortunate for the Battalion that all its big defensive battles
were fought during the year in which Colonel Segrave commanded,
for it was in such battles, rather than in attacks which had been
rehearsed in every detail, that able leadership meant so much.
Both at Bourlon Wood and in the Retreat the Civil Service
Rifles owed a great deal to the guiding hand of their Commanding
Officer.</p>

<p>But it was not only owing to his ability as a leader, nor to his
exceptional bravery under fire, that his presence gave such
confidence to the troops. They always knew that in Colonel
Segrave they had a Commanding Officer who devoted himself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
wholeheartedly to the welfare of the Civil Service Rifles. He
was a red-hot enthusiast for the Regiment, and would tolerate
nothing that was, in his opinion, likely to bring it into disrepute.
A tireless worker himself, he would have no idlers among his
officers, N.C.O.’s or men.</p>

<p>These are but a few of the qualities in Colonel Segrave which
cause men to speak with genuine pride of the fact that they
served under him. Outstanding among his characteristics was
his pure unselfishness. All that he did was done for his Regiment.
He sought no personal glorification. He indeed “did good by
stealth and blushed to find it fame.” But the splendid work
he did for the Civil Service Rifles during the hardest year of the
war can never be forgotten by those who had the good fortune
to serve under Colonel Segrave.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<span class="medium">THE GREAT ADVANCE</span></h2>

<p>A sensational change came over the military situation on the
Divisional front during August, 1918. When the month opened,
the front line Brigades were still holding the trenches outside
Albert, and were kept in a state of readiness to meet a German
attack. It soon became evident, however, that there would be
no German attack from that quarter, for it became known on
the 3rd of August that the Germans had withdrawn from Albert
and the positions around that town, and by the end of the
month the troops of the 47th Division, instead of being on the
defensive, were in pursuit of a broken enemy several miles east
of Albert, and open warfare prevailed once more.</p>

<p>When Colonel Segrave left it was not known who was to be
his successor, but in the meantime Major G. G. Bates, M.C.,
acted as Commanding Officer.</p>

<p>The first indication of the coming advance was a big attack
launched by the Allies at 4.0 a.m. on the 8th of August. The
Civil Service Rifles were at that time holding front line trenches
just outside Albert, on the north side of the Albert-Amiens road.
No attack was launched in that area, but there was increased
artillery activity throughout the day. On the following day an
attack was delivered by the 58th Division immediately south
of the 47th Division and an Australian Division further south.
Their objectives were the villages of Ville sur Ancre, Dernancourt,
Morlancourt, and the German positions in the vicinity. In
spite of a ground mist, which made it difficult to follow the
operations, the attack was a big success. The Civil Service
Rifles were not affected, though the Battalion scouts were sent
as spectators to a point of vantage to watch for any developments
likely to affect the front held by the 47th Division. It
was a curious sight to see a small crowd on a slope on the left
flank of the attack, watching the fight at fairly close quarters,
like a crowd at a football match.</p>

<p>About this time enemy aeroplanes were active at night,
bombing transport lines and billets at Warloy, and the Civil
Service Rifles lost their Acting Quartermaster, Second Lieutenant
A. L. Mills, and their Assistant Adjutant, Second Lieutenant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
P. J. Spencer, both of whom were bombed in their billet, which was
completely destroyed, the officers being dangerously wounded.</p>

<div id="i203" class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Sketch map to illustrate the movements of the 1<sup>st</sup> C.S.R. in the 47<sup>th</sup> Division Attack 22-25 August 1918.</span></p>
</div>

<p>On the 13th of August, after a short stay in support in
Baizieux, the Division moved south of the Albert Road and
relieved the 58th Division in the neighbourhood of Bray. The
Civil Service Rifles relieved the Queen Victoria Rifles in the
forward position of the support Brigade. The trenches occupied
were the old British and German front lines west of Morlancourt.
The Transport Section and Quartermaster’s stores moved to
the village of Bonnay, which was visited nightly by enemy
bombing planes.</p>

<p>On the night of the 16th of August the Battalion moved up
to the front line and relieved the 22nd London Regiment on
the right of the Divisional front in the Bois des Tailles, just
north of the village of Bray.</p>

<p>The Bois des Tailles had doubtless been a very pretty wood
in peace time, but it was now strewn with the debris remaining
after the German occupation. It had afforded good natural
cover for German guns, and in the valley which ran through
the middle of the wood were some rather palatial dug-outs.
The German guns were still in position, though the emplacements
had been destroyed and the ammunition was scattered about
the ground. Throughout its occupation by the Civil Service
Rifles, the Bois des Tailles was subjected to a steady bombardment,
gas shells being used freely every night. The aforesaid
valley became saturated with gas and the dug-outs were rendered
uninhabitable. Casualties were pretty heavy, and the five days
spent in what became known among the troops as “<i>toute de
suite</i> wood” were distinctly unpleasant.</p>

<p>At midnight on the 20th of August the 20th London Regiment
took over the positions in the Bois des Tailles, and the Civil
Service Rifles moved back to support positions in a valley near
Marett Wood, close to Mericourt L’Abb&eacute;. Here the new
Commanding Officer, Lieut.-Colonel R. C. Feilding, D.S.O.,
Coldstream Guards, took over the command of the Battalion.</p>

<p>Colonel Feilding had not had time to get to know his troops
before he was leading them in battle, for after one day’s rest
in support positions, the 140th Brigade moved up on the 22nd
of August and was the Reserve Brigade in a big attack launched
that morning by the 47th Division, in conjunction with the
12th Division on the left, and an Australian Division on the
right.</p>

<p>The programme for the 47th Division was that the 141st
Brigade holding the front line was to move forward at zero,
and capture and consolidate the first objective, known for this
battle as the Brown Line, running parallel with the Bray-Albert
road and about 500 yards east of it. The 142nd Brigade was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
to pass through the 141st Brigade ten minutes after zero, and
capture and consolidate the second objective (known as the
Green Line.) Corps cavalry and twelve whippet tanks were
then to pass through the 141st and 142nd Brigades, and capture
the Blue Line (a line of defences from Fricourt to the woods
known as Great and Little Bear), the 140th Brigade remaining
in Divisional Reserve, ready to move forward and consolidate
the Blue Line when captured.</p>

<p>Soon after 6.0 a.m. on the 22nd of August, the Civil Service
Rifles marched forward from the positions near Marett Wood,
and by 7.50 a.m. the Battalion was in position at the rendezvous&mdash;the
sunken road running north and south along the western
edge of the Bois des Tailles. Here a squadron of cavalry, about
80 strong, was waiting its turn to go forward, and just before
8.0 a.m. this squadron advanced to the attack, accompanied
by tanks, but both tanks and cavalry came dribbling back about
an hour later, having met with serious opposition.</p>

<p>The Companies of the Civil Service Rifles were now disposed
in the fields on either side of the road, awaiting orders. There
followed a long interval without any news, and throughout
the whole morning nothing definite was heard as to how the
attack had developed. Late in the afternoon, however, orders
were received as to the part to be played by the Civil Service
Rifles in an attack to be delivered by the 140th Brigade the
following morning upon the Blue Line. Colonel Feilding had
only just explained matters to Company Commanders, when
the order was cancelled owing to the withdrawal of the 142nd
Brigade from the Green Line, under pressure from the enemy,
and the reoccupation by the latter of the Happy Valley (a valley
just to the east of the Bray-Albert road, and about a mile
north-north-west of Bray).</p>

<p>A gap existed between the right of the 141st Brigade and the
left of the Australians, and the Civil Service Rifles were ordered
at 7.0 p.m. to fill the gap. Colonel Feilding sent two of his
Companies to the front line to dig themselves in along a bank
where the gap existed, and two Companies to be in support
along the Etineham-M&eacute;aulte road, just in front of the old front
line in the Bois des Tailles. He established his Headquarters
temporarily in the old front line north-east of the Bois des Tailles.</p>

<p>Darkness was falling as the Companies went to take up these
positions, and when Colonel Feilding arrived with his Headquarters
Company in the old front line in the Bois des Tailles
he found the Headquarters of the 141st Brigade close by. He
went into these Headquarters to see what further information
he could gather, and learnt that the enemy was breaking through,
and was believed to be coming on in large numbers. The trench,
he was told, should be put in a state of defence, and every rifle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
would be needed. Headquarters Company was thereupon
ordered to line the trench and each man had to make himself a
good fire position. Officers’ servants and signallers, who had not
used their rifles since the Retreat, had visions of a repetition
of the Bourlon Wood incident, and every man got to work with
his entrenching tool, and made every preparation for the coming
fight. Colonel Feilding pushed off into the darkness ahead to
find out how much truth there was in the story of the counter-attack.
He found all quiet in the front line, which was nearly
two miles ahead, and he decided to take his Headquarters
Company and two support Companies to the foot of a bank
close to the front line. These positions were occupied throughout
the next day, when there was considerable shelling from
the enemy.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 24th of August, an attack was
delivered on the Green Line and the Happy Valley. The 140th
Brigade was on the left and the 175th Brigade (58th Division)
on the right. The Civil Service Rifles were to move through
the Happy Valley behind a Battalion of the 175th Brigade, and
deal with the enemy in the many dug-outs in the valley. After
clearing the valley they were to take up positions just north
of Bray and on the east side of the Bray-M&eacute;aulte road, in
support to the 17th and 21st Battalions, who were to be by
that time in the Green Line.</p>

<p>The attack began at 1.0 a.m., and by 2.0 a.m. large parties
of German prisoners began to arrive at Battalion Headquarters.
The operation had been entirely successful, the Civil Service
Rifles having captured 300 prisoners in Happy Valley, as well
as a considerable number of machine guns and some trench
mortars.</p>

<p>After spending the whole day under heavy shell fire in the
positions near the Bray Road, the Battalion moved through
the Happy Valley again at night and assembled for a further
attack, which was to commence at 2.30 a.m. on the 25th.</p>

<p>For this attack the 140th Brigade was in front, with the 175th
Brigade on its right. The Civil Service Rifles were on the right
of the 140th Brigade, and the centre of the Battalion’s assembly
position was an old German prisoners-of-war cage on the Bray-Fricourt
Road. It was dark when the men reached the assembly
position, and the country was quite strange to all the attacking
forces, none of whom had even so much as seen it by daylight.
The objective was just over 2,500 yards beyond the assembly
position, and was a line of old German trenches on the western
edge of Billon Copse, about two miles south of Mametz. In
spite of the strange surroundings, total darkness, and the fact
that no reconnaissance had been made, the attack went well,
and the objective was reached with very few casualties&mdash;not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
more than thirty-five all ranks. The opposition was slight,
but a thick fog which settled down before daylight made it
very difficult to find even so prominent a landmark as Bronfay
Farm, which was about the southern boundary of the Civil
Service Rifles’ objective. The result was that when Colonel
Feilding reached the front line soon after 4.30 a.m., he found
that the troops were a few hundred yards short of the real
objective. However, he was able to guide them to the so-called
old German trench, which “A” and “C” Companies
manned as front line Companies, “B” and “D” remaining
in the railway loop behind in support.</p>

<p>So ended the first stage of the part played by the Civil Service
Rifles in the final advance of the Allies. It had been a long
drawn out battle, and the troops had had little or no rest since
leaving the trenches near Marrett Wood on the morning of the
22nd of August. The fighting, however, had not been severe,
and the total casualties during the few days were only sixty
all ranks, of whom only nine were killed.</p>

<p>The men were, therefore, in very good spirits when they
marched back, on the 26th of August, to the trenches near
Marrett Wood, taking with them one captured minenwerfer,
four heavy and ten light enemy machine guns.</p>

<p>There followed the usual visits from the Brigade Commander
and Divisional Commander, both of whom congratulated the
Battalion on its work during the past few days. They added,
however, the news that the advance would be resumed very soon.
Major General Gorringe explained that there would be no more
coming back to rest while the Division was taking part in this
advance. In future the transport lines would move up to the
Battalion after a battle, as the general scheme would be that
Brigades would be continually passing through each other, and
so the front line area of to-day would become the support or
reserve position to-morrow.</p>

<p>On the 29th of August the Civil Service Rifles marched to
huts in an old French brickfield about a mile north of Maricourt,
and close to Montauban. Battalion Headquarters was at
Carnoy Craters on the Carnoy-Montauban Road. These craters
were a relic of the Somme battle of 1916, when the attack often
opened with the blowing of a few mines. The Germans had only
recently left this district, and a sharp look-out had to be kept
for “booby traps.”</p>

<p>The 47th Division continued the advance on the 30th of
August, the 142nd Brigade being in front, the 141st in support,
and the 140th Brigade in reserve. The Civil Service Rifles
moved off from the Brickfields soon after 7.0 a.m., and after a
short cross country scramble, halted in Maurepas Ravine about
midday. Cookers and limbers followed the Battalion, and soon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
after halting, the troops received a pleasant surprise in the
shape of hot dinner. A draft of two officers and 100 other ranks,
who had been following the Battalion for some days, managed
to catch it up in Maurepas Ravine during the afternoon of the
30th of August. It was quite a novelty for a draft to join
during battle.</p>

<p>The Battalion bivouacked in Maurepas Ravine, and spent
the whole of the next day there, but on the morning of the
1st September there began what proved to be the last battle
in which the Civil Service Rifles were to take an active part.
It was a battle worthy of the occasion, and during the six days
while it lasted, the men lived up to the very best traditions
of the Regiment. There were very few indeed among them
who had embarked with the Battalion in 1915, or even of those
who had fought on the Somme in 1916, but the spirit was still
there, and the achievements of the 1st Civil Service Rifles in
this great battle are worthy of a detailed description. The
following account of the operation is founded upon the official
report written by Colonel Feilding when the action was over.
The narrative can best be followed by reference to the map
on page 211.</p>

<p>On the 1st September the 140th Brigade, in conjunction
with the 141st Brigade on the right, and the 18th Division
(55th Brigade) on the left, was to advance and capture Rancourt
and the line of trench following the south-west edge of St. Pierre
Vaast Wood. The 1st Surrey Rifles were on the right, the
Civil Service on the left, and the Poplar and Stepneys were to
follow up and “mop up” Rancourt and the trenches around
that village.</p>

<p>The assembly position for the Civil Service was a line about
three quarters of a mile south-south-west of Rancourt, between
the road leading from Rancourt to Le Forest and the road from
Rancourt to Marrieres Wood. Battalion Headquarters was at
the cross roads about half a mile east-north-east of Le Forest,
with advanced Headquarters in a shell hole near the assembly
position.</p>

<p>A certain amount of shelling was encountered on the way
up to the assembly position, and the Battalion lost, among
others, Sergeant Moore, signals sergeant, one of the few remaining
“17th of March men,” who had been present with the Civil
Service Rifles throughout their stay in France.</p>

<p>The assembly position was reached at 5.0 a.m., and zero was
at 5.30 a.m.</p>

<p>Some anxiety was felt when, at three minutes before zero,
the 1st Surrey Rifles had not arrived, but thanks to Second
Lieutenant Gray, the Civil Service Intelligence Officer, touch
was established before zero.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span></p>

<p>After a five minutes’ “crash” by the artillery, “C” and
“D” Companies moved forward behind a creeping barrage to
take the final objective, followed by “A” and “B” Companies,
who were to be in support in trenches running north and south,
quarter of a mile east of Rancourt.</p>

<p>The attack was completely successful, prisoners beginning
to come down within ten minutes of zero.</p>

<p>Lieutenant E. R. Lascelles, commanding “C” Company,
was killed early in the advance, but otherwise the losses were
slight, and by 7.30 a.m. all objectives had been reached, and
were being consolidated. Touch was obtained with the East
Surreys (55th Brigade) on the left, but there was a gap on the
right, the 1st Surrey Rifles having been held up.</p>

<p>During the process of consolidation “B” and “D” Companies
were shelled heavily from a German Field Gun Battery which
remained in action in the open, firing over open sights from
about 1,000 yards’ range.</p>

<p>An attempt by the enemy to rush through the gap on the
right was prevented by Lewis gun and rifle fire from developing,
and this brought to a close a good day’s work in which the
Civil Service Rifles had taken 150-200 prisoners and ten machine
guns.</p>

<p>The battle, however, was by no means over, and at 11.30 p.m.
the Battalion was relieved by the London Irish and marched to
an assembly position on the Rancourt-Peronne road, just S.W.
of Bouchavesnes and 300 yards north of the old quarry there, in
readiness for a further attack the next morning. Arrived at
this assembly position, the Company cooks again earned the
gratitude of their comrades by producing an excellent hot
meal.</p>

<p>The operation of the 1st of September had been simple and
straightforward, and had been carried out without a hitch,
but a much more complicated attack took place on the 2nd.</p>

<p>The plan was that the 74th Division should attack from
trenches immediately south of Moislains Wood and, after
capturing and mopping up Moislains, should take the village
of Nurlu. The 140th Brigade was to follow them closely, the
Civil Service on the left, the Poplar and Stepneys on the right,
and the East Surreys in support. After crossing the Canal du
Nord east of Moislains, the 140th Brigade was to wheel left,
forming a defensive flank on the high ground to the north of
Monastir trench, where they were to join up with the 142nd
Brigade, who were to capture this trench. The order from left
to right on the defensive flank was First Surreys, Civil Service,
Poplar and Stepneys. The 140th Brigade was to follow the
229th, who would also prolong the defensive flank, facing
north as far as Nurlu.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span></p>

<p>The Battalion was in position at 3.0 a.m. and zero was at
5.30 a.m., but, in order to get well up behind the 229th
Brigade “A” and “B” Companies led off at 5.0 a.m. with
“C” and “D” in support and Headquarters bringing up the
rear.</p>

<p>The 140th Brigade was to pass Moislains on the south, and
the formation of the defensive flank therefore presupposed the
capture by the 74th Division of that village.</p>

<p>From the outset the Brigade came under heavy shell and
machine gun fire, and as it moved down the slopes to the south
west of Moislains, under still heavier machine-gun fire directed
from the village and from both flanks.</p>

<p>The casualties caused by this fire were enormous, amounting
to more than half the strength of the Battalion, but the men
went forward without any hesitation, and, as Colonel Feilding
said afterwards, as though they were beating up partridges.
The behaviour of the Civil Service under this sweeping fire
was commented on by the Commanding Officers of other units
present, who said they had never seen anything like it. The
determination of all ranks was ultimately rewarded when
they succeeded in establishing themselves in Moislains trench,
with details of the First Surreys on the left, the Poplar and
Stepneys on the right, and an officer and about a dozen other
ranks of the North Devon Yeomanry.</p>

<p>The garrison of Moislains trench now had to fight hard to hold
the position, for the enemy were occupying the same trench to
the left and Quarry trench in the left rear, while they could
clearly be seen moving in Moislains a quarter of a mile in front,
and assembling in the village and around the huts immediately
south of it.</p>

<p>Simultaneous counter-attacks were, in fact, developed on the
left rear and on the right front, while the enemy at the same
time attempted to bomb up the trench on the left.</p>

<p>Both parapet and parados were manned, and the attacks
across the open were beaten off, but the bombing attacks
continued all day, and, owing to scarcity of bombs, were with
difficulty held up.</p>

<p>It was at once obvious that there were no British troops in
front of the 140th Brigade, though elements of the 74th Division
could be seen in the distance on the right, on a level with
Moislains trench. In the face of the very heavy flank and
frontal machine-gun fire, of the heavy casualties incurred
and of the fact that one flank at least was “in the
air,” it did not seem practicable to Colonel Feilding or to
Colonel Dawes, commanding the First Surreys, for their
Battalions to assume the r&ocirc;le allotted to the 74th Division, and
to attempt, without a barrage, to capture the village, which,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
as a result of the failure, or absence, of that Division, was still
strongly held by the enemy.</p>

<div id="i211" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i211.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Sketch Map to illustrate the movements of the C.S.R. from 1 Sept 1918 TO 6 Sept 1918</span></p>
</div>

<p>A small local attack by about two Companies was actually
delivered by the 74th Division on the right, but, though it made
some little progress, and at one point crossed the Canal, it
hardly did more than establish the right flank of the 140th
Brigade. With this exception, there was no indication of any
attack having been delivered by the 74th Division in the
vicinity of Moislains. A German Field Gun Battery was, in
fact, in action for some four hours in the open, immediately
south of the village, and less than 1000 yards east of the Canal,
firing over open sights on to the part of Moislains trench occupied
by the 140th Brigade.</p>

<p>Colonel Feilding was able to confirm the foregoing account by
a very careful examination of the battle-field made afterwards.
He saw no British dead either in Moislains or between Moislains
trench and the village. The only dead in the vicinity of
Moislains trench were those of the 140th Brigade and of Germans
killed in the counter-attack previously referred to. Twenty-five
men of the Civil Service were found and buried in an hour
in this area alone, and others of the Brigade were still lying
there.</p>

<p>To quote from Colonel Feilding’s report:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The only dead of the 74th Division whom I personally saw
in the section of ground with which my Battalion was concerned
were lying about 300 yards from our starting point&mdash;the Rancourt-Peronne
road. Since these dead were not there when we originally
advanced, I can only come to the conclusion, which is shared by all
who were with me on the battlefield during the action and after,
that here, at least, the 140th Brigade, instead of being in support,
found itself with its flanks unsecured, and with the barrage so far
ahead as to be useless, carrying out the main attack on a strong
enemy position, and that the 74th Division, so far from being in
front of us, was behind us.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The position in Moislains trench was held until 10.30 p.m. on
the 2nd of September, when the Brigade Commander withdrew
the troops, and the survivors of the Civil Service Rifles marched
back about three miles and rested in trenches just east of
Rancourt.</p>

<p>The Battalion rested here for two days, but even then the
fighting was not over, and, reorganised owing to heavy losses
on a two Company basis each with two platoons, the Civil
Service Rifles took part in another fight on the 5th of September.
At 5.30 a.m. on that day, the 141st Brigade passed through the
142nd, and was followed by the 140th at 8.0 a.m., the Poplar
and Stepneys in front with the Civil Service and one Company
of the First Surreys attached in support.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span></p>

<p>The Civil Service assembled in Pallas trench, south-west of
Moislains Wood, and at noon the two Companies had moved
forward and occupied Sorrowitz trench (a continuation of
Moislains trench, north-west of Moislains) with Battalion Headquarters
and the attached Company of the First Surreys in the
sunken road 300 yards behind. Half an hour later, “A-B”
Company under Lieutenant R. Upton, crossed the Canal and
occupied a position facing north-east on the Canal bank in a
continuation of Monastir trench about a quarter of a mile
north-east of Moislains. At the same time “C-D” Company,
under Captain L. D. Eccles, crossed the canal and occupied a
trench further south, parallel with the canal and facing east,
formed a defensive flank. The remaining Company was kept
in reserve in and around Sorrowitz trench.</p>

<p>At 7.0 p.m., considerable opposition having been met with
from the enemy, an organised attack was made on the Peronne-Nurlu
road by the Poplar and Stepneys in conjunction with the
141st Brigade and the 12th Division on the left. The right was
protected by Captain Eccles’ Company and the operation was
entirely successful.</p>

<p>At 6.0 a.m. on the 6th of September the advance was resumed.
The 19th and 20th Battalions (141st Brigade) moved across the
Peronne-Nurlu road, and at 8.0 a.m. the London-Irish and the
Civil Service, who had formed up behind in conjunction with
the 12th Division on the left and the 74th Division on the right,
advanced on a position running north and south, just south of
the village of Lieramont.</p>

<p>The Civil Service reached the objective about noon and
the men came under heavy machine gun fire from the left, where
the London-Irish had not yet arrived. In addition, rapid fire
from enemy field artillery raked the men as they appeared over
the crest in front of the final objective. Colonel Feilding
accordingly took his men back to the reverse slope, where they
immediately turned and dug in.</p>

<p>This position turned out to be the “farthest east” of the
Civil Service in the advance on this part of the Allied front,
for during the night of the 6th-7th September the Battalion
was relieved by the Queen Victoria Rifles (58th Division) and
moved back to bivouacs in a valley about a mile east of Moislains,
close to the position occupied by Captain Eccles’ Company on
the afternoon of the 5th of September.</p>

<p>The fighting, so far as the Civil Service Rifles were concerned,
had come to an end for a time, and the short rest in this valley
near Moislains enabled a thorough search to be made of the
scene of the heavy casualties on the 2nd of September. The
bodies of all the killed of the Civil Service in that battle were
buried before the troops left. There was also an opportunity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
to count the cost, and it was found that the casualties suffered
during the first six days of September numbered 12 officers
and 317 other ranks, out of a total trench strength of less than
500 all ranks.</p>

<p>It has already been mentioned that Colonel Feilding had not
had time to get to know his men before he was leading them in
battle, but what he saw of them in the battles of August and
September filled him with genuine admiration for and pride in
the men whom he commanded and he at once became fired with
the enthusiasm of his two predecessors. The troops, on their
part, were not slow to see that the Regiment had been fortunate
in gaining a worthy successor to Colonel Segrave for in these
final battles Colonel Feilding’s energy knew no bounds. He
was constantly faced with unexpected developments but he
was never at a loss as to how to deal with them. From start to
finish he was “here, there and everywhere” moving about
among the Companies seeing things for himself. What struck
the troops most forcibly perhaps was his coolness, for although
on the 2nd of September particularly, he was faced with
difficulties sufficient to put the best soldier “off his game” he
was perfectly calm and unruffled throughout.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<span class="medium">BACK TO THE COAL-FIELDS</span></h2>

<p>It is a far cry from the battle-field to the coal-field, but after the
events narrated in the last chapter, the 47th Division returned
to the area which it occupied during its first few days in France.</p>

<p>On the 7th of September the Civil Service Rifles went by bus
from the vicinity of Moislains to billets at Heilly, and after two
nights in that once delightful village, entrained in the afternoon
of the 9th for Chocques. The train journey took just over 12
hours, and it was consequently in the small hours of the 10th of
September when the Battalion reached its billets in Chocques.
Two days later, the 140th Brigade marched to the Auchel area,
where it remained until the 27th of September.</p>

<p>Auchel is not by any means a pleasant village, but after the
Somme battlefield any place was welcome, and the three weeks
spent here were very enjoyable, concert parties and football
matches being the great attraction. The chief excitement at
this time, however, was the prospect of a trip to Italy. Definite
orders had been received for the 47th Division to be transferred
to the Italian front, and more than once during the stay at
Auchel the Civil Service Rifles actually received entraining
orders. The last entrainment order was for the 26th, but,
like the others, it was cancelled, and on the 27th of September
the Brigade marched to the St. Pol area, the Civil Service
Rifles being allotted some very poor accommodation in
Foufflin-Ricametz.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of October the Division was transferred to the
5th Army. The Civil Service Rifles moved by train from
St. Pol to Merville and marched thence to Lestrem, which was
reached at 4.30 a.m. on the 3rd of October. There the men rested
in tents for a few hours and in the afternoon the march was
continued to Fauquissart, where the night was spent in dug-outs.</p>

<p>On the following day the 47th Division began an advance on
to the general line Beaucamps-Radinghem, with the ultimate
object of taking Lille. The Civil Service Rifles occupied reserve
trenches at Le Maisnil, the advance being carried out by the
141st and 142nd Brigades.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

<p>It was no doubt in order to avoid unnecessary casualties, and
also to avoid doing any further damage to the town, that the
taking of Lille was a slow process. There was no determined
attack made on it directly, but one by one the various strategical
and tactical positions were captured, and the Germans were
forced to clear out eventually on the 17th of October. The
capture was a somewhat tame affair, and the first intimation
that the British troops had was when a few civilians timidly
came out and announced that the Germans had gone. For
some days afterwards pickets were posted at all the entrances
to Lille and only a privileged few were able to enter the town.</p>

<p>The early part of October was uneventful for the Civil Service
Rifles. It was certainly a change to get back once more to
trench warfare, but it was only for a day or two, and after the
short stay at Le Maisnil, a few days were spent in reserve near
Fromelles and on the 14th of October the Battalion marched
to Estaires, thence on the 15th to St. Venant, thence to Norrent
Fontes, where the Battalion trained for ten days.</p>

<p>Arrangements had now been made for a triumphal march of
British troops through Lille and the Civil Service Rifles entrained
at Berguette on the 26th of October, and after a journey across
the devastated area which had been No Man’s Land for more
than three years, detrained at Perenchies and marched to Lomme,
a suburb of Lille, which was reached at about 7.0 p.m.</p>

<p>The march from the railway station to the factory in Lomme,
where the Battalion was billeted, was a memorable one. On
approaching the suburb the regimental band struck up the
Marseillaise and kept it up throughout the march. The
inhabitants&mdash;old men, women and children&mdash;threw up their
windows or lined up on the roadside to sing the words they had
not forgotten during the four years of German rule. The kiddies
ran by the side of the troops and insisted on shaking hands.
The welcome indeed was so spontaneous that it was more
impressive than the ceremonial affair two days later.</p>

<p>It was appropriate that the 47th Division should have been
selected for the triumphal march through Lille, as it had spent
more time in the front line around this town than had any
other Division. Further, it claimed to have been the senior
division in France at the taking of Lille.</p>

<p>For this, “<i>L’Entr&eacute;e Solennelle des troupes Britanniques</i>,” as it
was advertised in the town, which took place on the 28th of
October, “C” Company was detailed to form part of a cordon
round the Grand Place, and the remainder of the Battalion
took part in the long procession through the gaily decorated
streets between the cheering crowds of the recently liberated
populace.</p>

<p>The Battalion proceeded to Hellemes, a suburb on the eastern
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
side of Lille, and were again billeted in a factory, where German
field-post letters were strewn about the floor and orders to
troops still posted on the walls. In the afternoon nearly every
one enjoyed the interest of a visit to the town, where famine
prices prevailed. In several shop windows the following
placard printed in red, white and blue had been placed:</p>

<p class="table">
<span class="trow tdc">“HONOUR AND GLORY TO THE <span class="small">47TH</span> DIVISION.</span>
<span class="trow tdc">OUR DELIVERERS.”</span>
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Lille</span>, le 17 Octobre, 1918.”</p>

<p>The enterprising Canteen Manager of the Civil Service Rifles
sought out the publisher of this poster and secured a batch of
posters for sale as souvenirs in the Regimental Canteen. One
of them has been framed and now hangs on a wall of the dining
room in the Civil Service Rifles’ Club.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV<br />

<span class="medium">THE ARMISTICE</span></h2>

<p>Although the inhabitants of Lille considered the war to be
over&mdash;as it undoubtedly was so far as they were concerned&mdash;the
guns could still be heard out on the Tournai road, and on
the 30th of October the 47th Division left Lille and continued
the pursuit of the enemy. The Civil Service Rifles marched
along the Tournai road and spent the night at Chereng, continuing
the march next day to Froyennes, a suburb of Tournai,
where they relieved the 2/4th South Lancashire Regiment in
the front line under conditions which have surely never existed
before in any part of the front line in any war.</p>

<p>Froyennes is a suburb of convents and magnificent ch&acirc;teaux.
One of the latter had been the Headquarters of Prince Rupprecht
of Bavaria when he commanded a German Army Corps. It
now became the Headquarters of a half of “A” Company of
the Civil Service Rifles.</p>

<p>There were no trenches in the front line at Froyennes, the
sentry posts being either in the front room of a house, the back
garden or a street corner. In one street the Germans occupied
houses on one side, and the Civil Service Rifles the houses
opposite.</p>

<p>The suburb was pretty freely shelled, mostly with gas shells,
but the houses for the most part were not very badly damaged.
In a good many of them and in most of the convents the
civilians had remained. They had been allowed to do so
because it was thought at first that the advance would soon
carry the front line beyond Froyennes.</p>

<p>The advance, however, was held up for some days along this
line, which followed the general line of the River Scheldt
hereabouts. The Scheldt ran through Tournai and outside
the eastern and northern borders of Froyennes.</p>

<p>Tournai was still occupied by Germans at this time, and, as
at Lille, the capture of the town was a somewhat slow process.</p>

<p>The situation in Froyennes remained unchanged for some
few days, the posts, as has been stated, being mostly in houses
by daytime. By night, further posts were held alongside the
roads.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span></p>

<p>The Company Headquarters were all either in ch&acirc;teaux or
convents. “A” Company Headquarters was in the Ch&acirc;teau
Beauregard, the residence of the Comtesse Th&eacute;r&egrave;se de Germiny,
who, although her house had been knocked about by a shell
which came through her drawing room wall, remained in
residence. The Countess was the “Lady Bountiful” of the
village, she having taken under her wing all the poor and homeless
who cared to accept her hospitality. To these she gave
not only a home, but also refuge from shell fire in her cellars.</p>

<p>The Countess spoke excellent English, and by the kindly
interest she took in the comfort of the troops occupying her
ch&acirc;teau, she became quite a favourite of the men of “A”
Company.</p>

<p>The “B” Company Headquarters was in a convent for the
aged and infirm. In this building were nuns, many of whom
had been bedridden for years before the war began. These
invalids had all been moved down into a cellar, which the troops
endeavoured to make gas proof.</p>

<p>The front line posts were held by “A” “B” and “C”
Companies, “D” being in reserve. Roughly speaking, “A”
Company was responsible for the east of the village, “B” the
south, and “C” the north.</p>

<p>“C” Company’s front, in fact, was right outside the town,
the posts being between the river and the main road running
from Tournai to Courtrai, though by day the men were withdrawn
to houses. This front was much wider than that allotted
to the other two Companies and it was more in the open. The
Company Headquarters was in a convent at the western edge
of the suburb. Civilians shared the accommodation with the
troops, and it is said that the children played in No Man’s Land
by day.</p>

<p>Between the posts along the road and the River Scheldt was
a wide marsh, and it was the duty of patrols at night to make
their way across the marsh and creep along the river bank.</p>

<p>“C” Company had further excitement on the night of the
3rd of November when the Royal Engineers tried to bridge the
Scheldt, which at this point is quite a narrow stream. Two
platoons, acting as covering party, got into position on the
river bank without any difficulty, but as soon as the work began,
an enemy machine gun across the river opened fire. The
bridging operations were shut down for the night, and the troops
were lucky to get away without casualties.</p>

<p>“D” Company occupied a large building, a convent which
had been deserted, near the “C” Company Headquarters.
The men had had many a worse billet, even when out of the
line.</p>

<p>The shelling became more frequent as time went on, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
casualties occurred to several civilians. On the 3rd of November
the civilians were ordered to evacuate Froyennes. Hitherto
they had simply been advised to go, and told that transport
would be lent to them to help them remove their belongings.
But it now became necessary to compel them to go, and on the
night of the 3rd a fleet of motor ambulances and other transport
took them all to a place of safety in Lille. It was a pathetic
sight to see the poor old creatures from “B” Company’s convent
being loaded into ambulances, for they had accepted the situation
in the cellar so calmly and philosophically, and they were now
loath to leave what had been their home for so many years.
It was almost a self-supporting convent, for in the gardens
vegetables of all kinds were grown. Many fowls and rabbits
were also kept, and the Mother Superior on her departure presented
these to “B” Company. Roast fowl in the front line
was a luxury which surprised the oldest soldier in the Company.</p>

<p>It should not be thought, however, that life at Froyennes
was free from the horrors of war for, the Civil Service Rifles
lost one killed and ten wounded in the five days spent there.
After the assurance from the people of Lille that the war was over,
this was regarded as a heavy casualty list. Of these casualties,
Private G. A. Watson, “B” Company, who was killed on the
2nd of November, proved to be the last man of the 1st Civil
Service Rifles who was killed in action.</p>

<p>The Battalion was relieved on the 4th of November, and
marched to reserve billets in the village of Cornet, just off the
main road, and half-way between Tournai and Lille.</p>

<p>Froyennes had been described as a village of convents and
ch&acirc;teaux. Cornet can only be described as a village of hovels
and mud, but the squalor of this wretched place was forgotten
in the excitement caused by the news that the war was now
“all over bar shouting,” and that the signing of the terms of
the Armistice was expected daily.</p>

<p>The Bulgars, the Austrians and the Turks had already accepted
terms, but these had caused no excitement. The only terms
that mattered to the troops in France were those to be imposed
on the Bosches. A big sweepstake was organised in the Battalion
at Cornet on the hour at which the Armistice terms to Germany
would be signed. But before the prize was won the military
situation in the immediate vicinity had undergone a change,
and the Civil Service Rifles were pursuing the enemy in open
warfare once more.</p>

<p>News was received on the 9th of November that the Scheldt
had been crossed and the Germans had left Tournai. The
Battalion immediately left Cornet and moved to Froyennes,
Companies occupying their old billets. Pursuit of the enemy
was slow owing to the fact that the pontoon bridge constructed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
by the Royal Engineers at Froyennes was the only passage across
the river for the whole Division. The arrangement was for
the two Infantry Brigades holding the front line to advance
simultaneously, with the Reserve Brigade following close up.</p>

<p>The 140th Brigade on the right accordingly advanced on
Melles, a village about six miles north-east of Tournai on the
main road to Ath. The Civil Service Rifles, being the Reserve
Battalion, did not move beyond Froyennes on the first day
of the advance, but on the 10th of November the Battalion
crossed the river and joined in the hunt. Although the advance
was continued well beyond Melles the Germans had retreated
so quickly that they were not seen even by the advanced guard,
and the 140th Brigade halted for the night in the villages around
Montroeul Au Bois, the Civil Service Rifles being billeted in
the little hamlet of Barberie. The natives gave the troops a
warm welcome, for it was only on the previous night that they
had been compelled to shelter the retreating Bosches.</p>

<p>It was now decided that each Brigade in turn should furnish
the advanced guard for the advance of the Division, and the
140th Brigade was detailed to act in that capacity on the morrow.
The Civil Service Rifles would be the vanguard, and the details
were explained to Company Commanders late on the night
of the 10th. The Battalion scouts, on bicycles, were to move
off at 6.45 a.m. and keep in touch with the cavalry screen furnished
by the 19th Hussars. The Companies were to move
off at 7.30 a.m. and the duty of the Battalion was to advance
on the general line of the river Dendre and seize the bridges
over the Dendre canal on the outskirts of Ath, not far from
Brussels.</p>

<p>This would have given the Battalion its first experience of
vanguards in real war, and the troops were eagerly anticipating
a visit to Brussels during the next few days. These hopes,
however, were never fulfilled, for at 2.30 a.m. on the 11th of
November, the news reached the Battalion that the orders
for the advance were cancelled. No explanation was given, and
a rumour that the war was over was strengthened by an order
received later in the morning for the Battalion to march back
to Tournai.</p>

<p>The rumour was discredited when the Battalion got on the
main road to Tournai and met a whole Division going in the
opposite direction, but when a low-flying aeroplane appeared,
gaily decorated with coloured ribbons and making a terrible
noise with its Klaxon horn, there could be little doubt that the
Armistice terms had been signed. This was confirmed by a
passing officer in a motor-car, and the news was conveyed to
the troops by the Regimental Band, who, by a happy inspiration
of Sergeant Blackmore, the Bandmaster, struck up an air which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
had been popular throughout the British Army during the
past four years:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“When this ruddy war is over<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, how happy I shall be.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>It should be placed on record that this was the only intimation
of the armistice which reached the Battalion beyond announcements
in the Press. The Civil Service Rifles received no official
news that an armistice had been granted, although a telephone
message from Brigade on the night of the 12th of November
gave particulars of the various armaments, etc., which were
to be surrendered.</p>

<p>Tournai was reached in the afternoon of the 11th of November,
and the men were once more accommodated in a convent, where
the nuns came out in a body and expressed their gratitude to
the British troops.</p>

<p>So the Civil Service Rifles saw the end of the Great War,
and a tamer finish it is impossible to imagine. There were
many whose ambition it had been to be in the front line on the
last day of the war, and many were the conjectures as to what
it would be like, but none ever guessed that it would fizzle out
in such a miserable and uninteresting fashion. To be left to
read of it in the newspapers was about the feeblest finish that
could have happened, and while there were jubilations in London
and elsewhere on armistice night, there was absolutely nothing
in the area occupied by the 140th Infantry Brigade in the nature
of a celebration of so great a victory. The district was very
gloomy, and its name, La Tombe, appeared a very appropriate
one.</p>

<p>Things looked up somewhat on the following evening, when a
Battalion concert was held in the Convent, to which the civilians
were invited. They did not understand a word of the concert,
but they applauded everything vigorously, and at the close,
when the chairs were cleared away, the natives went fairly mad
with joy at an impromptu dance.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<span class="medium">HOME</span></h2>

<p>Little remains to be said of the history of the 1st Civil Service
Rifles in France, but before the story is closed mention should
be made of a few incidents which stand out in the last few months
before demobilisation was complete.</p>

<p>After the concert at Tournai the Battalion once more marched
out along the road to Brussels, but this time the route was along
the lower road, and the troops were employed for a time in
repairing the railway at Leuze. They were billeted in the
little village of Pipaix, where they made great friends with the
villagers and were very happy. It was hoped that even yet
they would get to Germany, but a bitter disappointment was
in store, for it was decreed that the 47th Division should end
its career in France in the same district where it started, and
in less than a week the Civil Service Rifles left Pipaix for Willems,
a village between Tournai and Lille, where a week was spent
before starting the trek across the devastated area to the mud
and squalor of the coal-fields around Auchel.</p>

<p>It should perhaps be mentioned that to Sergeant Haycock,
the Battalion Pioneer Sergeant, fell the distinction of being
the first member of the Battalion to be demobilised. He left
Willems for that purpose on the 23rd of November, 1918.</p>

<p>The journey to the coal-fields began on the 26th of November,
and, after a night in the suburbs of Lille, the interest of the
trek, especially to “the 17th of March man” consisted in a
last glimpse at the ruins of La Bass&eacute;e and the Double Crassier,
dominating the village and battle-field of Loos, and, later, the
brick-fields at Cuinchy he had fired at so zealously nearly four
years ago. The night of the 27th of November was spent at
Bethune, within a stone’s throw of the Girl’s School where the
Battalion had been quartered on its first visit to the line. Suppers
were obtained at small caf&eacute;s in the suburbs, but those who
looked for the gay patisseries they once knew now found the
site of the old town, including the picturesque church, belfry
and H&ocirc;tel du Nord, a desolate waste of charred bricks!
The next day a war-worn and weary Battalion reversed the
march described at the beginning of Chapter II, the journey
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
being extended some two kilometres beyond Cauchy-a-la-Tour
to Ferfay.</p>

<p>In spite of Ferfay having been a Corps Headquarters, the
accommodation at first was poor, but the troops soon settled
down, and, making the most of the wretched conditions, contrived
to have a jolly good time during their last days in France.</p>

<p>A number of N.C.O.’s and men distinguished themselves as
educational instructors at the classes which were held daily,
and Sergeant Blackmore’s “Sunday League Concerts” became
quite a popular weekly function.</p>

<p>A good deal of football was played, and the Battalion got
together excellent teams, both Rugby and Association.</p>

<p>The Association match against the 2nd Battalion Civil Service
Rifles, who were beaten by four goals to three, on the 14th of
December, was the event of the season. The crowd was a
record one and included about 100 members of the 2nd Battalion
who were billeted about twelve miles away. In the evening
a concert was held in the theatre, the programme being provided
by talent from both Battalions.</p>

<p>After a really merry Christmas the Battalion began to melt
away. Demobilisation began in earnest with the New Year,
and parties of twenty-five or thirty left for England almost
daily. Large crowds assembled outside the Battalion Headquarters
to give the lucky ones a rousing send-off, and the
procession through the village was headed by the Regimental
Band, until the day came when the Band played itself out of
the village and left for home.</p>

<p>Before that day came, however, the Band had supplied the
orchestra for a highly successful revue, “Pack up,” which was
played in the theatre by a company of officers, N.C.O.’s and
men of the Civil Service Rifles trained by Corporal Bailey of
“B” Company. The “book” was written by Major D. Young,
M.C., second in command of the Battalion, the music was “put
together” by Second-Lieutenant P. H. Small, and the play
was produced by Corporal Bailey. R.Q.M.S. Hart excelled
himself with the wonderful stage effects which he devised.</p>

<p>Of the actors special mention should be made of Private
Perrin, Captain “Florrie” Ford, and the two “girls,” Lance-Corporal
Harnett and Lance-Corporal Flight, and Sergeant
Taylor. But the whole Company is to be congratulated on
the best show ever given by a Battalion concert party. The
production got such an enthusiastic reception that it was given
at Auchel and other places for the benefit of other units.</p>

<p>Although demobilisation began just before New Year, it was
not until the 10th of May, 1919, that the last remnants, the
“Cadre,” consisting of about thirty all ranks, reached England.</p>

<p>It should perhaps be mentioned that there was not a single
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
officer, N.C.O. or man outside the Quartermaster’s staff and
transport section who served with the Battalion continuously
throughout its stay in France.</p>

<p>Included in the Cadre was Sergeant Teasdale, a member of the
Regiment for nearly twenty years. For more than nineteen
of his twenty years he had been a humble private, and as a
raconteur at Regimental concerts he never had an equal. He
had been in France with the 1st Civil Service Rifles as a member
of the Quartermaster’s staff ever since the Battalion landed
in 1915. It is said that he accepted his third stripe owing to
the keen demand for his stories in the Sergeants’ Mess.</p>

<p>The two war trophies that had been preserved by the Civil
Service Rifles and brought home also deserve special mention.</p>

<p>One generally expects a war trophy to be some instrument
of war, but the Civil Service Rifles war trophies were an instrument
of music, viz., a piano, and a presidential chair.</p>

<p>The piano was captured at Nurlu during the heavy fighting
on the Somme in the first days of September, 1918, and the
Regiment is chiefly indebted to Major Young for this uncommon
trophy. It is also through the ingenuity of the same officer
that the Regiment was represented in the salving of H.M.S.
<i>Vindictive</i> at Ostend, whence came the “presidential chair,”
for it was through his efforts that two pioneers of the Civil
Service Rifles found their way to Ostend in 1918, and worked
on the salved ship, producing out of a piece of teak taken from
the decks, a handsome chair on which the Regimental crest
is carved. Thus it transpired that whereas their keenest rivals
in the London Regiment are said to have sunk the <i>Emden</i>,
the 1st Civil Service Rifles can claim to have salved the <i>Vindictive</i>.</p>

<p>The home-coming of the Cadre was an even more dismal
experience than the celebration of the Armistice, for the party
was taken stealthily to Felixstowe of all places, and from there
the members drifted away one by one until all that remained
were Colonel Feilding and Colour-Sergeant Chubb, the Orderly
Room clerk. These were then permitted to return to Somerset
House.</p>

<p>But although the Battalion had, as it were, been scattered
to the four winds, the spirit of comradeship, which had been
so characteristic of the Regiment in war, still prevailed in peace-time.</p>

<p>Already, before demobilisation was nearly completed, a
meeting of members of the Regiment had been held at Somerset
House, and it had been resolved to proceed forthwith to found
a Club as a memorial to those of the Regiment who had lost
their lives in the war, and as a place of reunion for those who
survive. A temporary home was found at Somerset House,
where the School of Arms was converted into a lounge, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
on the 28th of April, 1920, the Club was opened by Major-General
G. D. Jeffreys, G.-O.-C. London District, who congratulated
the Civil Service Rifles on being the first Territorial unit to
form such a club, which forges a link between the old generation
and the new in the Regiment, and where, for many years to
come, the new members of the Regiment will be able to meet
those who, in the Great War of 1914-1918, helped to make
history for the Civil Service Rifles.

<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p>This brief story of the 2/15th Battalion, London Regiment,
is written, not as a specimen of literary art, but merely as a
record of the work of the Battalion during the War of 1914-1918.</p>

<p>It is compiled from rough notes in my pocket diary, and
probably some of the events in the experience of others have
been overlooked, and to these I offer my apologies.</p>

<p>I have to thank Lieutenants J. L. Hutchinson, M.C., and
T. H. E. Clark for their kindness and assistance in furnishing
the notes for the greater part of Chapters IX and XI, especially
the accounts of the Capture of Jerusalem, the Turkish Counter-Attack
at Tel el Ful, and the journey to Es Salt. In these
actions both these officers served with distinction.</p>

<p>I have also taken the liberty to include extracts from a Brief
History of the 30th Division in France, in writing up the last
three chapters of this book.</p>

<span class="medium">FORMATION&mdash;TRAINING&mdash;IRISH REBELLION, 1916&mdash;AND DEPARTURE FOR FRANCE, JUNE, 1916</span></h2>

<p>During the early days of August, 1914, the Headquarters of the
Civil Service Rifles at Somerset House was besieged by crowds
of younger Civil Servants; either wishing to re-enlist in their
old Battalion, or to start their military career in the Civil Service
Rifles, which had been mobilised for Active Service. Many of
them were able to gain an entrance into the 1st Battalion, but
others were disappointed. From the latter the nucleus of a
second line unit was formed, and eventually the War Office
authorised the existence of a new Battalion, the 2/15th Battalion,
County of London Regiment.</p>

<p>The feeling of a separate existence brought with it great
enthusiasm, and although arms, equipment and stores were
slow in coming, every one worked hard to make an efficient
unit. Training was carried out in the London parks, and each
morning the semi-equipped army of recruits marched out of
Somerset House for the day’s work. Indeed, so slow was the
equipping of the Battalion that many of the keener members
wondered whether they would be “too late for the war.”</p>

<p>However, before very long the new unit, under the command
of Lieutenant-Colonel R. G. Hayes, T.D., left London for Dorking.
This was, indeed, a pleasant change from the Metropolis,
where friends constantly asked the budding rifleman, “Why
aren’t you at the front?”</p>

<p>Training was pursued with more realism in the new area;
organisation improved, and the novelty of “billets” was still
prevalent. A word of appreciation for the kindness of the
people of Dorking might well be included in this book. They
did all they could to make the new soldiers comfortable.</p>

<p>Route marches among the beautiful Surrey Hills and sham
fights over the surrounding country-side soon brought the
physique of the men to a high standard, and the rigors of a cold,
wet winter were easily borne. Leith Hill, the pleasure ground of
many a week-end in previous years, became the training ground
of England’s new armies. True, the pack and the rifle made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
the climbing stiffer, but keenness and enthusiasm to get out to
fight the Bosche helped one to forget the additional fatigue.</p>

<p>Early in the spring of 1915, drafts were furnished for the
completion of the 1st Battalion at Watford, which had then been
ordered to France. This depleted the ranks of the younger unit,
but recruits arrived from Somerset House, where a third line
depot had been established, and the 2nd Battalion soon recovered
its numbers, and shortly afterwards followed in the footsteps of
the 1st Battalion which had then left for the front.</p>

<p>The move of the 2nd Battalion from Dorking was the first
real move as a unit, and was creditably done. How many hours
of worry and labour it involved does not concern us here, but
what a contrast to the 2nd Battalion of two years later, which
moved its home complete within a couple of hours after the
receipt of orders; every one working with the precision of an
automatic machine.</p>

<p>Following so closely on the heels of our 1st Battalion at
Watford, added to the welcome of the people of Hertfordshire.
The impression left by the parent Battalion was exceedingly
fine, and the Watford folk looked upon the 2nd Battalion as part
of a regiment they loved; in fact, they felt a part ownership
in the Civil Service Rifles, and continued to thrust upon us all
those wonderful kindnesses they had so recently bestowed upon
the 1st Battalion. Houses were thrown open for entertainment,
baths and meals; and there was no difficulty in billeting;
every one was welcomed into the household. It must be remembered
that at this time the billeting of troops in private
houses was new to the people of Britain. In some parts it was a
matter for misgivings and suspicions. In Watford, however,
the whole town opened their hearts to welcome the Battalion,
and, in fairness to the troops, it must be recorded that they lived
up to that splendid standard expected of them as soldiers and
gentlemen.</p>

<p>The stay at Watford was indeed a happy one, and training was
carried out in the local parks at Cassiobury and Munden. Each
day areas for manœuvres were allotted to the various Battalions
of the Brigade, now known as the 2/4th London Infantry
Brigade, comprising the second line units of the Kensingtons,
London Scottish, Civil Service and Queen’s Westminsters.</p>

<p>Musketry was done at Chalk Hill ranges, a few miles from
St. Albans, and by the summer the Battalion was an efficient
unit. The earlier heart-burnings of the “fire-eaters” that
they would be “too late” were dispersed; the war on the
continent had developed into a far greater conflict than many
had ever imagined.</p>

<p>In June, 1915, the Battalion, now under the command of
Lieutenant-Colonel E. F. Strange, trekked to Saffron Walden,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
and encamped in Audley End Park. It was a lovely English
summer, and all will remember the glorious golden carpet of
buttercups in the camp; undoubtedly one of the prettiest camps
in England. Being under canvas was a new experience for
many, but the Battalion soon settled down to its new life away
from the home comforts of Watford.</p>

<p>Here the summer of 1915 was passed. Training on similar
lines to that at Watford was continued. Classes were instituted
for specialists. Day after day the same routine was pursued,
until rumours furnished the only excitement; and such rumours
too! Was the Battalion to be kept in England on Home
Service? Had the War Office forgotten its existence? Was
not the Battalion good enough? Was it to be a draft-finding
unit? etc., etc.&mdash;such were the questions that resulted from these
rumours.</p>

<p>Then came the furnishing of a draft of about 100 strong to
the 1st Battalion in France, and this in the minds of many sealed
the fate of the Battalion. Never would the 2nd Battalion take
its place as a fighting unit in the Great War.</p>

<p>However the horizon brightened, and all those men who had
only volunteered for home service were ordered to be transferred
to the 3rd line unit. It is not for anyone to comment
upon the actions of others; circumstances alter cases, and
during the war to act up to the dictates of one’s own conscience
was the duty of all. Nevertheless, the departure of the home
service contingent was a matter of great relief to the 2nd
Battalion. True, many good friends were lost, and many who
had striven hard for the efficiency and well-being of the Battalion
had to bid farewell; but for those who remained there was that
resuscitated feeling that the 2nd Battalion would some day
take its proper place in the fight on the continent.</p>

<p>Fresh drafts were received, and a large training company was
established where men qualified as trained soldiers and then
passed into their respective companies. New N.C.O.’s had
to be found, and special classes of instruction were organised, and
again the Battalion felt itself to be an independent unit, every one
earnest for foreign service.</p>

<p>This history of the Battalion’s doings at Saffron Walden
must contain a reference to the two treks, the one to Furneaux
Pelham and the other to Braintree and Stebbing. It was during
these two expeditions that the 2/15th had their first real taste
of campaigning; a day’s marching, an outpost or an attack,
then a night in the open, which was the nearest approach to the
actual war obtainable in England. From a military point of
view the success of these operations was, of course, doubtful;
every one had different views, but as a well-known Brigadier
always said to the 1st Battalion at the end of a day’s operations,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
“Shot and shell would tell.” However, there can be no doubt
that they proved conclusively that the spirit of the Battalion
was right, and that all the inconveniences of treks were taken, by
all, as part of the game.</p>

<p>By this time winter was approaching, and the canvas camp
at Saffron Walden was becoming a rather cheerless place on wet
days. On the 26th October, 1915, the Battalion proceeded by
road to billets at Bishop Stortford. The whole of the Brigade
was billeted in the area, and memories of the happy days at
Watford sprung up. The billets were good, and the local people
made the Battalion welcome. It is true many billets were
crowded, but the size of the town would not admit of so large a
concentration as the Brigade, less the Kensingtons who were
billeted in a village a few miles south. The stay, however, was
not to be a long one, for no sooner had the central cook-houses,
miniature range, etc., been thoroughly established, than orders
for a move to Ware were received.</p>

<p>On the 29th of November the Battalion packed up, and after
a long march of about sixteen miles arrived at Ware. An earnest
welcome was given by the townspeople, and the prospect of
Christmas in Ware caused every one to keep a bright look-out
for any good things Ware might produce. The officers of the
Battalion formed a regimental mess in a large, roomy house at
the top of the hill overlooking the town, where most of the officers
were billeted. In the same building an excellent dining-room, a
smoke-room and a card-room had been arranged, all of which
proved to be great boons, more especially as the attractions of
Ware in the way of evening entertainments were few.</p>

<p>The local drill hall was taken over as a central place for
battalion messing, each company marching from its own area
for meals. At Christmas time this hall was used for concerts,
and a splendid Battalion dinner was held on Christmas Day.
Some of the less fortunate members were, however, detailed at
that time for aeroplane guards in the surrounding villages.
Ware was on the outer defences of London against air raids, and
pickets were arranged in the Ware district, armed with mysterious
rockets for the purpose of representing anti-aircraft batteries.
However, on no occasion was it necessary to use these alarming
fireworks, and in spite of being on duty, these outlying posts are
believed to have spent a very jovial Christmas. Leave was
freely given, and the proximity of Ware to London was a great
advantage, as was proved within a very short time; for on
the 22nd January, 1916, the Battalion entrained during the night
for Salisbury Plain.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon of the 23rd, Warminster was reached,
and after a march of about four or five miles a city of comfortable
looking huts appeared. Their apparent comfort, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
quickly disappeared when the mud of Longbridge Deverill came
into evidence. The interior of the huts so recently vacated
by a division which had left for France, was little better than the
filth outside. However, the Battalion was now becoming
accustomed to this kind of thing, and soon settled down. Improvements
were made in the camp, and competition between
the various units of the Division for the smartest camp was soon
astir. The whole Division (now known as the 60th (London)
Division) was concentrated between Longbridge Deverill and
Sutton Veny. The divisional R.E., A.S.C., R.A.M.C., and
R.F.A. appeared in reality, and it was obvious to all that the
Battalion was at last part of a real fighting division destined at
some time or other to go abroad.</p>

<p>Everything was advancing at a pace, and stores and material
were brought up to War Establishment. Training and musketry
was being completed, the Regular Army Course having been fired
on the local range. Manœuvres by the whole Division became
daily routine, and inspections were frequent. Hopes ran high
for an early departure for France, when suddenly, on the 28th
April, 1916, the Battalion was ordered to proceed to Ireland with
the rest of our Brigade.</p>

<p>Political events in Dublin had developed into war during
Eastertide, every one was full of the possibility of Dublin; others
said that France was the real destination, and the orders for
Ireland were mere camouflage to deceive the Hun; while others,
less optimistic, imagined a permanent exile in Ireland for the
duration of the war.</p>

<p>However, all rumours were soon dispelled during the night
of the 29th April, and the Battalion entrained at Warminster
bound for Neyland near Pembroke Dock.</p>

<p>The following day was Sunday, and the Battalion spent a
beautiful summer day on the grassy slopes facing the sea, awaiting
embarkation to an unknown port, while the officers were
kindly entertained by the Officers’ Mess of the 4th Welsh Regiment,
which was stationed a few miles inland. Late in the
evening a large quantity of rations was issued, and the prospect
of a long sea journey arose in the minds of most of us. The
night, however, was without alarms, and not until the following
morning did the Battalion embark. Part of the unit, together
with the transport section, sailed on the <i>Archangel</i>, and the
remainder on board the <i>Rathmore</i>; both transports leaving the
harbour early in the evening.</p>

<p>Here was real adventure at last, sailing to an unknown
destination through seas frequented by enemy submarines. At
daybreak the coast of Ireland was sighted, and at 4.30 a.m. we
were alongside the quays of Queenstown. The disembarkation
was without incident beyond the warning that we were now in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
“enemy” country. We proceeded straightway through the
town to Belvelly Camp on Fota Island. No demonstration was
made by the Irish people, and no one could understand why they
should be regarded with suspicion. Smiles greeted the troops,
and the unfortunate Battalion Signalling Officer, who was leading
the Battalion on the march, was severely reprimanded by his
superior for talking to some charming Irish damsels. The
B.S.O. excused himself on the grounds that he was asking
the way; a reply which brought forth a still further admonition
for “enquiring of the enemy.” The new camp on Fota Island
was situated in a beautiful Irish park, the property of Lord
Ballymore, and for the next few days the Battalion was engaged
on ordinary field training and not a bloodthirsty battle as many
had anticipated.</p>

<p>The weather turned wet, and this fact alone appears to be a
sufficient reason for the “Staff” to order a move with its
consequent discomfort. On the 6th May the Battalion left
the camp at Belvelly and proceeded to Ballincorrig via Cork.
The march was performed in the rain, though while actually
passing through the City of Cork the weather became kinder, and
the streets were lined with the citizens, none of whom appeared
to be really warlike. The real sensation, however, was an officer
of the Munsters who passed the Battalion. He wore a steel
helmet, which at that time was unique and rarely seen in the
United Kingdom, and the atmosphere of real war conjured up
by that single steel helmet somewhat counteracted the peacefulness
of Cork. Leaving the town was to leave the finer weather;
for the rest of the journey the downpour was terrific, and when
the Battalion reached Ballincorrig no one was sorry. The
Battalion was housed in the local cavalry barracks, and every one
will remember the splendid comradeship of the artillerymen
stationed there, who did all they could to attend to the needs
of the soaked Battalion. The riding school was full of tired
Londoners, but how they welcomed those steaming “dixies”
of tea prepared by the barracks cooks. Tiredness soon disappeared,
and fraternising was the “order of the night”;
officers to the officers’ mess, sergeants to the sergeants’ mess,
and men to the canteen. The horrors of the day’s march of
16 miles in the rain were forgotten, and a pleasant evening was
spent. A word of thanks is also due to those artillerymen who
so kindly took over the Battalion transport on arrival and
groomed and fed the horses. Here, indeed, was the brotherly
spirit, which existed so strongly in the British Tommy,
illustrated.</p>

<p>The next morning the Battalion was astir early, the march
was resumed, our destination being Coachford. The journey
was shorter, about 12 miles, and the Battalion marched through
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
some of the most beautiful Irish scenery, small villages like
Dripsey on the route, with its tiny hovels sheltering animals
and fowls in the living rooms, gave us an insight into Irish village
life. Coachford, a sleepy little Irish village, was reached in the
evening, and tents, which had been conveyed in advance by
motor lorries, were soon erected on the local recreation ground,
and the Battalion nestled down for the night. The next day
the march was continued as far as Macroom, the day was fine
and the march fairly short. Early in the afternoon the town
of Macroom was reached, and the population turned out to
welcome the Battalion. The camping ground was situated on
the river banks in the grounds of the ancient castle of Macroom.
By evening time the Battalion had settled down and every one
hoped for a long stay in this glorious spot. The following day
was market day in Macroom, and the town was crowded with
people from the surrounding villages and farms; officers and men
were allowed in the town, a happy release after the restrictions
in existence since our arrival in Ireland. Shops were besieged
and luxuries were purchased to supplement the rations of
“active service.” Talking of purchases, most members of the
Battalion will remember the famous small goat bought by an
officer, which although an affectionate animal, became a nuisance
by thrusting its vocal efforts upon that tent in any battalion
camp which should be approached with bated breath, a salute
and the word “Sir.”</p>

<p>Mystery surrounded the first armed party of about 100 strong
which left the camp that night under the guidance of the Royal
Irish Constabulary. However, the following morning all was
common knowledge; a few Irishmen had been arrested, while
the farm in which they lived had been surrounded by the troops
to prevent escape. These were the “rebels” which the Battalion
had set out to quell.</p>

<p>The stay at Macroom only lasted a few days, and the Battalion
continued its march inland under the command of Major A. A.
Oliver; our Commanding Officer Lieutenant-Colonel Strange
having been sent to hospital seriously ill. Only a privileged few
knew the day’s destination, but towards dusk the Battalion
halted near Mill Street and turned off the main road into a field
where tea was soon prepared by the company cooks. No
tents on motor lorries were to be seen; a drizzle set in, and
every one wondered whether it would mean a night in the wet
with only waterproof sheets, which had already done great
service throughout the day. Several hours passed, no orders
were forthcoming, and every one became pessimistic. Finally,
however, an entraining officer was appointed with the usual
complement of N.C.O.’s and this ended all discussion. The
Battalion was to move off by train. The geography of Ireland
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
had been forgotten since school days and the names of likely
places were confined to the Limerick and Dublin areas; however,
about midnight the Battalion marched to the station at Mill
Street, entrained rapidly and steamed out into the gloom of a
wet, misty Irish fog. Tired by the day’s march of 16 miles
over the moorlands of the Bochragh Mountains every one slept,
and no one troubled about our destination. Great was the
surprise, however, the next morning to wake and find that the
train had pulled up on Rosslare Pier. France was in every one’s
mouth, and then the memory of the Quartermaster Stores and
rear details at Warminster dispelled such ideas. The day was
spent on the stone pier of the harbour and eventually at 7 p.m.
the Battalion set sail on the <i>Connaught</i>, reaching Fishguard
after a pleasant crossing of four hours’ duration. Little did one
think that within a few weeks the same troopship would convey
the Battalion to France. Within an hour of reaching Fishguard
the Battalion was entrained and started for Warminster, which
was reached about 7 a.m. on the 13th May, 1916. After a short
march we arrived back at our old camp at Longbridge Deverill.
The visit to Ireland soon appeared like a dream, so sudden and
so short had it been. The value of the “Irish stunt,” as it was
commonly called, cannot be discounted, even if actual warfare
had not been encountered. The Battalion had learnt to entrain
and detrain; embark and disembark; and move its home day
by day and in general to become a mobile unit. The experience
was invaluable.</p>

<p>Back in Warminster the old question cropped up: “When is
the Battalion going to France?” The slightest alteration in the
daily routine was regarded by the numerous Sherlock Holmes in
the Battalion as distinct clues pointing to an early departure
for the front. However, signs soon became very real when
additional Lewis guns, field dressings, active service pay books,
and identity discs, were issued, and soon the Battalion was
complete in regard to stores. A final medical examination was
held and innoculation and vaccination were soon in full swing.
Embarkation leave was granted and one whole day was spent
before the camera; photographs of companies, sections and
specialists were taken. Every one was hopeful.</p>

<p>On the 31st May, 1916, the whole division was inspected by
H.M. The King, and it was a splendid sight to see the troops in
review order on the slopes of the Wiltshire Downs. The 60th
Division was fit and ready for the front; and on the 21st June,
1916, the final orders were received and the following morning
the Battalion, under the Command of Lieutenant-Colonel C. de
Putron, entrained at Warminster for Southampton. Many of
the townsfolk turned out in the early morning and gave us a
hearty send-off.

<span class="medium">FRANCE, 22ND JUNE, 1916, TO 19TH NOVEMBER, 1916&mdash;IN THE TRENCHES AT NEUVILLE ST. VAAST&mdash;BATTALION RAID&mdash;JOURNEY TO MARSEILLES.</span></h2>

<p>The journey to France was without incident; the train from
Salisbury Plain arrived at Southampton Docks about midday
on the 22nd of June, 1916, and after a few hours on the quayside
the Battalion embarked on board H. M. Transport <i>Connaught</i>,
the boat which only a few weeks before had brought us over
from Ireland. Complimentary messages from the Embarkation
Staff on the excellent and business-like behaviour of the Battalion
pleased us. At about 10 p.m. we set sail, and the calm
sea made the journey comparatively comfortable. True, it was
crowded on board, but not to that extent that it reminded one
of the proverbial “sardines in a box.” During the morning of
the 23rd of June the Battalion set foot on the Continent at Havre.
Great excitement prevailed; the novelty of France, the quaint
French poilus in their blue service kit; everything, in fact,
seemed to belong to that world of dreams that had for so long
evaded us; while a group of German prisoners of war on the
quayside added spice to our first taste of foreign service. Rain
set in, however, and made the short march to the rest camp
distinctly unpleasant.</p>

<p>Leave was granted to limited numbers, who immediately
availed themselves of the “good things” in the town, and
incidentally the opportunity of airing their French, much of
which was of the “primer” lesson book type, and was neither
greatly appreciated nor understood by the townspeople, who
replied in good English. But the French people are so polite
that one is encouraged to persevere.</p>

<p>The Battalion retired to their tents for the night, but an
early r&eacute;veill&eacute; at 2.30 a.m. reminded every one that they were
now on “Active Service,” and soon the whole camp was astir
preparing to move. After a wait of many hours the Battalion
left (less “B” Company, which moved later in the day) for the
station, and were entrained in the famous “8 Chevaux, 40
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
Hommes” wagons of which we had heard so much. Any discomfort
in travelling in these trucks was recompensed by the
novelty of our new surroundings. The French people by this
time had become serious over the war, and the route was not
lined by cheering crowds as had been the case in the earlier
days of the war; though the French children on the route
still made frequent requests for bully beef, biscuits and cigarettes,
in their best “Engleesh.” The journey terminated on the
25th in the St. Pol area, and the Battalion soon marched to its
billets in the villages of Penin, Averdoight, and Roellecourt.
These were the first billets in France, but every one managed
to settle down comfortably whether in a cottage or in a barn.
The local “vins rouges et blancs” were sampled, and the
2/15th Londons appreciated the mystic word “estaminet” for
the first time. At times the rumble of heavy artillery could be
heard in the distance, and this brought home to us the fact
that we were nearing the firing line. Orders were received the
following day to move forward to Maroeuil, a few miles north
of Arras. The Battalion formed up on the high road from
Penin, and started off gaily enough on a glorious summer evening.
An advanced aerodrome was passed on the way, and the
planes in the air, and the observation balloons in the distance,
helped to make the first part of the marching interesting.
Gradually the night clouds gathered, and a heavy downpour of
rain rather “spoilt things.” French “pav&eacute;” roads which
up to this time had been traversed unnoticed, became torture
to tired feet, and troops billeted on the line of march were
envied; however, the Battalion plodded along, and by 11 p.m.
reached the battered town of Maroeuil, where a few civilians
still remained. Not realising that the town was close to the
firing line, and under the direct observation of the German
lines, the Battalion freely used its hurricane lamps which reflected
their rays on the ruined walls of the buildings, and there can
be no doubt that the salvos of shells that greeted us on our
arrival had been “asked for.”</p>

<p>Only two men were wounded slightly; not forgetting “A”
Company’s cooker, which received a direct hit. However, these
incidents were quite sufficient to make us realise the unpleasantness
of war. Billets were soon found under the able guidance
of the “Scotties” of the 51st Division, who apparently knew
all the cellars in the town. The Battalion, after having a hot
meal, went to bed feeling tired, but many spent a restless night
wondering when the next strafe was due. The night was, however,
quiet, and the next day, the 27th of June, was spent in
finding our way around the town, and investigating the few
estaminets which remained open, where we were regaled with
the horrible details of war by the men of the 51st Division of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
Scottish Territorials who were then holding that part of the
front line. The following morning the Battalion moved a few
miles farther north under the cover of the valley behind the town
as far as Bray, which nestled behind the ridge of Mont St. Eloy,
and was out of observation by the Bosche. The Battalion
was housed in large Army huts, similar to those we had left on
Salisbury Plain. Every one was relieved to get away from the
dingy cellars of Maroeuil, our unpleasant reception having
given most of us a bad taste of the village and its cellars. On
the 29th of June, the Battalion left Bray via Maroeuil for the
firing line, and by means of deep communication trenches,
which had been dug for a distance of four to five miles from the
front line system as far back as Maroeuil, the relief was carried
out by day. This was a great advantage to the new Battalion
as it became accustomed to that weird feeling of being in a
trench, before the night fell and obliterated all.</p>

<p>The surrounding country was covered with red poppies, and
the setting sun shone gloriously on this carpet of colour. On
the way ruined farms were seen at points of vantage, and near
the main road from Arras to Souchez, with its avenue of trees
destroyed by shell fire, we passed the famous Maison Blanche, a
deep dug-out, large enough to hold a battalion. In nearly every
depression in the ground were cleverly camouflaged battery
positions, the sight of which encouraged us in our new venture.
After a long march through communication trenches the reserve
line of the Elbe shelters in a sunken road was reached, and
companies were distributed in the support and reserve areas for
the night. Seven days after leaving England the Battalion
was in the firing line. During the night of the 29th of June, the
Bosche raided the trenches of the “Black Watch” in the front
line, and many of the Battalion who got mixed up in the “Box”
barrage will never forget the terrific local bombardment which
lasted for some twenty minutes. The Battalion was fortunate
and sustained no loss, but the “Black Watch” unfortunately
lost about ten men killed and missing, while others were wounded.
For the next few days the Battalion was held in support and
reserve, and tours of duty in the front line were made by officers
and N.C.O.’s, under the instruction of the “Black Watch.”
Dug-out life was studied, and every one became acquainted
with the new routine. The Battalion soon acquired the attitude
of the “man in the line,” and very many thanks are
due to those battalions of the Scottish Division which so kindly
assisted us to pick up the threads of trench life. On the 2nd
of July, 1916, the Battalion took over the front line, and became
responsible for that part just north of Roclincourt, and in
front of Neuville St. Vaast. The weather was unkind, rain
made the trenches extremely unpleasant, and together with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
the constant salvos of enemy trench mortars known as “Grey
Pigeons,” “Lead Pencils,” “Oilcans,” and so on, according
to their various shapes and sizes, those first few nights in the
line proved rather trying to the Battalion of novices. Casualties
were few, and the men soon learnt the “unhealthy” spots
in the line, and avoided them whenever possible. This section
of the front which was adjacent to the “Labyrinth” had been
held by the French during the earlier stages of the war, and
sad and gruesome relics of the heavy fighting by our gallant
Allies were numerous in the trenches. The Battalion set to
work, and did a great deal to improve them, though our work
was constantly being destroyed by the intermittent bombardment
of the enemy’s trench mortars and minenwerfers.
Wiring along the front was improved, and patrols were sent out
each night into “No Man’s Land,” although the proximity of
the Bosche did not allow much latitude in this respect. At
this time the great Somme Offensive had commenced, and the
heavy artillery fire farther south could be distinctly heard; and
although the 2/15th Londons had not participated in the actual
fight, there was a great consolation in the fact that the Battalion
was at last holding part of the line, thereby releasing more
seasoned troops for the offensive and at the same time preparing
themselves for their turn when it should come.</p>

<p>The insertion of a sketch of this sector might prove interesting
at this point, for it was here that the Battalion was destined
to spend its stay in France.</p>

<p>The front held by the 179th Brigade was from the Stone
Communication Trench on the north to the Victoire Communication
Trench on the south, about 2,500 yards in all. Two
battalions held the front lines, a third battalion forming
the supports and reserves, while the fourth battalion of the
Brigade was out at rest at Bray. The 2/15th always occupied
the right sub-sector of the Brigade front being relieved by the
2/14th (London Scottish); while the 2/13th and the 2/16th
Battalions shared the responsibility of the left sub-sector.</p>

<p>The right sub-sector in which the Battalion was located ran
from the Vissec Communication Trench to the Victoire, on the
right flank.</p>

<p>This sub-sector was again divided into three company fronts
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) Vissec C.T. to Bentata C.T.</p>

<p>(2) Biras Sap to Point ‘D.’</p>

<p>(3) Point ‘D’ to Bonnell Avenue at Point ‘A.’</p></blockquote>

<p>The front line proper ran along the Doublement, MacIntyre
Street, across Argyle Street to Bonnell Avenue. The support
line ran parallel to the front line at distances varying from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
70 yards to 150 yards at the different places, while between the
front line and the support line an intermediate line, chiefly
occupied by machine guns and trench mortars, had been constructed.
Forward of the front line an observation line had
been dug, and in the centre of the Battalion front a strong
redoubt known as the Paris Redoubt had been constructed.
From the front line system connection with the rear was maintained
by four arterial communication trenches, the Vissec,
Claudot, Douai, and de la Vase. Many minor trenches made
the whole system a perfect maze, and many disused trenches
added to the difficulties of the network.</p>

<p>Three companies of the Battalion held the front line while
the fourth company was in support on the right flank; the
left flank support being furnished by the third battalion in the
Brigade. While holding the line, Battalion Headquarters
were situated in the Elbe Shelters, but when the line was handed
over, and the Battalion had become support or third battalion
of the Brigade, Battalion Headquarters transferred their activities
to Maison Blanche.</p>

<p>On the 5th of July the Battalion were taken out of the line
for a “rest,” but the word proved a misnomer. The Battalion
was taken back as far as the Aux Rietz Cave in rear of Neuville
St. Vaast and La Targette. Three companies were located in
the cave, while “A” Company were billeted in dug-outs near
La Targette. In the front line the Battalion had the good
fortune to be housed in excellent dug-outs bequeathed to us
by the French, but in no place on the whole British front could
have been more secure from air-raids and shell fire than the
Aux Rietz Cave.</p>

<p>Down wooden steps for over a hundred feet the weary infantrymen
stumbled, and finally a wonderful underground world presented
itself. A large cave capable of holding a thousand men,
with hundreds of small candles lighting its sombre darkness, was
the new home of the Battalion. Down here cook-houses were
established, and all were able to roam about free from bombs,
shells and bullets. A hot meal was soon prepared, and the weary
Tommies soon fell asleep, in spite of the great heat and oppressive
“fugginess” of their underground dwelling. The Battalion had
not, however, escaped all the horrors of war, for the orderly
sergeants of companies soon appeared and detailed numerous
working parties, which were sent up the line that same evening
to furnish Royal Engineer mining fatigues. Within a few hours
most of the Battalion was retracing its steps through miles of
trenches, knee deep in mud and water, to the front line, and after
about six or eight hours strenuous work lifting and carrying
heavy sandbags full of clay, they returned to the cave at Aux
Rietz. A few hours’ respite was granted, and then the working
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
parties were again paraded for another tour of duty with the
Royal Engineer sappers. In fact, for several days it was a
constant procession day and night of weary working parties
leaving and returning to the cave. No one grumbled at the
actual work with the Royal Engineers, but the long journey to
and from the line provided sufficient for a “grouse”; every one
longed for the front line again. The desire was quickly granted,
and the Battalion were soon back in the trenches, and not until
the 4th of August was it relieved. During this long stay in the
line the Battalion became “old soldiers.” The cook-houses
in the Elbe Shelter were thoroughly organised, and provided a
hot meal each day to the men and a cup of hot cocoa each
morning at “stand down.” The daily post and canteen stores
came up with the rations each night, having been brought as
far as Battalion Headquarters by the transport and Quartermaster’s
staff; from which point company ration parties carried
them to the front line. Specialists such as signallers, snipers,
and bombers, overcame the various difficulties of their work.
Every man learnt the way round his own particular sector;
names of trenches, saps and craters became familiar, in fact the
whole place became “a home from home.” Friends were
made with the artillery forward observation officers and men,
and the tunnellers on our front became companions in distress.
A great deal of mining was carried on in this part of the British
front, and our tunnellers were extremely busy combating the
activities of the Bosche, and many restless nights were spent
wondering whether the constant tapping underground was that
of friend or foe.</p>

<p>Casualties were fortunately not very heavy, although one
recollects with sadness such incidents as the dug-out in Argyle
Street being blown in, burying Sergeant Wigney and his gallant
fellows, but on the whole the Battalion had been lucky.</p>

<p>On the 4th of August the Battalion was relieved and marched
back to Bray, this time for a real rest. The Quartermaster’s
staff had prepared a hot meal, and after this repast was finished
every one settled down for a well-earned rest away from the
continual noise of the front line. The next few days were spent
in cleaning up, replacing damaged equipment and boots, writing
letters (not forgetting the censoring) and attending sundry
parades. Dinners and suppers of varying degree were held
either in the huts or in the local estaminets, and every one appreciated
the restful green fields and shady trees near Bray, which
had not been destroyed by the ravages of war. Entertainment
was provided at Acq by the Divisional concert party, and our
own Battalion concert party, “The Plumes” of Warminster
days was resuscitated in an endeavour to add to the gaiety of
life. On the 9th of August His Majesty the King visited the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
observation posts at Mont St. Eloy near by, and many of the
Battalion were privileged to line the route and cheer His Majesty
who was accompanied by His Royal Highness the Prince of
Wales (our Honorary Colonel) and the Commander-in-Chief, Sir
Douglas Haig.</p>

<p>On the 12th of August, after a week’s rest, the Battalion again
proceeded to the line, and the old life amid the constant “strafes”
of the Hun was resumed. Reliefs between companies were
carried out with precision, and various fatigue parties, sap
guards, gas guards, patrols and wiring parties kept every one
busy. Parties of officers and N.C.O.’s spent a few days with
the artillery batteries for the purpose of instruction. Nothing
of importance, however, marked this tour in the line, and on
the 1st September the Battalion was relieved and marched
back to the huts at Bray.</p>

<p>On the 6th of September, we were again ordered up to the
trenches. This tour of duty was to be one of importance. A
mysterious section of two officers and twenty men were left
behind to train for a raid on the Hun lines. The party was under
the command of Lieutenant B. Peatfield, with Second Lieutenant
G. E. Thompson as his second in command. The raid was of
considerable importance as information of the exact disposition
of the enemy was urgently required at General Headquarters in
order to ascertain which German Divisions had been withdrawn
from the heavy fighting on the Somme. The raiding party were
trained over a facsimile of the actual ground over which they
were to raid which had been dug near Divisional Headquarters.
When the party arrived at the trenches on the 10th of September,
excitement in the Battalion ran high. The raiders, all of whom
were volunteers, were located in a small dug-out in the Paris
Redoubt, and made preparations for the show. Unfortunately
Private Rule, “B” Company, one of the party, was killed by a
trench mortar shell that afternoon, but undaunted the remainder
looked forward to the adventure. The raid was to be launched
from the Paris Redoubt on the night of the 11th September, and
was to be supported by covering fire from our trench mortars
and machine guns while the artillery assisted the operation with
a heavy local “box” barrage. Early in the evening all the
officers concerned in the raid gathered together at Battalion
Headquarters in the Elbe, and final instructions were issued,
and watches were synchronised. Just as this party came out
of the dug-out a salvo of shells arrived and caused great consternation,
but no casualties occurred. That evening all sap
guards were strengthened, and in the middle of the night every
one “stood to,” when suddenly the barrage from our lines burst
forth with a terrific crash, and the raiding party with its blackened
faces sallied forth. No one but those who actually took
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
part in the raid can describe the inferno which reigned for the
next few minutes. The Hun soon sent up his S.O.S. signals
and retaliatory fire opened up, but most of this fell in the “D”
Company area on the left flank of the operation, where two
lamps had been specially erected to mislead the enemy as to the
actual part of the line from which the raid had started. Shortly
afterwards the success of the raid was wired to all companies,
and a sense of relief overwhelmed the Battalion. Apparently
our fellows had followed closely to the creeping barrage of our
trench mortars and had entered the Hun trench, killing or
wounding the occupants, and bringing back a few prisoners.
Luckily none of our men were killed although wounds were
numerous among the raiders, and unfortunately Private J. F.
Small of “B” Company succumbed later to his severe injuries.
Both officers had been badly wounded but stuck to their job,
and inspired the men by their example. Second Lieutenant
G. E. Thompson, together with Private A. Small, returning to
the Hun trench to rescue the latter’s brother who was found to
be missing at the first roll call.</p>

<p>Valuable information had been obtained, and only the death
of Private J. F. Small, who had been so gallantly rescued, marred
the operation. Credit must be given to the artillery, machine
gunners, and trench mortar batteries who so ably assisted in
making the raid a success.</p>

<p>The raid placed the Battalion on a high footing, and great
credit is due to all concerned.</p>

<p>On the 25th of September, the Battalion was relieved, and
although nothing of importance happened after the raid, for
many nights afterwards we expected a return visit from the
enemy.</p>

<p>The return to Bray was accompanied by the usual luxuries
of baths at Maroeuil, the concerts at Acq, and the refreshments
of the local estaminets. On the 26th, ribbons were presented
by the Divisional General to those members of the raiding party
who had escaped unwounded; while on the following day the
Corps Commander, Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Fergusson,
K.C.B., inspected the Battalion. A few days afterwards, on the
30th September, orders to return to the line were received, and
the march was accomplished without loss, although the enemy
artillery was active on the roads leading up to the trenches.
Nearing the line a great activity on the part of the enemy machine
gunners and snipers was noticed, and it was learnt that during
the night the Germans had exploded two large mines on our
front near the Claudot Sap. The London Scottish were holding
that sector of the line that night, and it is to their great credit
that the Hun made no inroads on our front. How great a fight
they had made was best judged from the heavy casualties they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
had sustained. “D” Company of the 2/15th relieved this part
of the front, and by dint of hard digging under considerable fire
soon consolidated the new craters, and linked them up by saps
with the observation line. Days of comparative quiet ensued,
although at this time the enemy commenced to use large trench
mortar shells standing some thirty-six inches high, with a
diameter of ten or twelve inches. As a retaliation for this unwelcome
increase in the size of missiles a deep emplacement was
made in rear of “D” company’s sector in the Bessan Redoubt,
and in it was placed a very heavy type of British Trench Mortar,
having a projectile of similar proportions to those introduced
by the Bosche. This shell was nicknamed the “Flying Pig,”
and to fire it was only an experiment, so all the men in the
trenches in advance of the emplacement were temporarily withdrawn
lest the shell should accidentally fall short. The test was
successful, and large craters about ten feet deep, and twenty
yards wide were made in the Hun lines. However, the experiment
was not taken by the Hun in the right spirit, and retaliation
on his part for the next few days was very brisk. A strafe of
shells from guns and minenwerfers of all calibres was poured on
to the unoffending infantrymen’s heads. Dug-outs were blown
up, but the resultant casualties were small. “D” Company’s
headquarters dug-out was destroyed, and the signallers were
entombed, but several hours work got them out, and they were
rescued little the worse for their experience.</p>

<p>After these few days of continual bombardment a sigh of relief
was breathed when the Canadian Division much depleted in
numbers through heavy fighting on the Somme, marched up to
take over the trenches at Neuville St. Vaast, and the Battalion
left this sector for the last time.</p>

<p>Rumours of transferring our activities to the Somme were
soon afoot, and after a few days rest at Bray, the Battalion
made tracks for the Abbeville area via Hermaville, Frevent,
Auxi-le-Ch&acirc;teau, and Beauvoir Rivi&egrave;re. Each night billets were
arranged in the villages en route, and pleasant evenings in the
local estaminets were spent after the day’s march. The weather
was only moderate but the Battalion was well seasoned by now,
and cared little for the discomfort of the trek after its long stay
in the trenches. The Battalion finally halted at Franci&egrave;re a
few kilometres south of Abbeville, and leave to England was
granted to a privileged few. Preparations for a journey to the
East were made, and these soon dispelled all rumours of fighting
on the Somme.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 15th of November, the Battalion
marched to Longpres and entrained on the familiar “8 Chevaux
et 40 Hommes” troop train bound for Marseilles, leaving Longpres
at 4.0 p.m. The journey to the south of France was most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
enjoyable, and the route taken was via Montreau, Dijon, Macon,
Pierre Latte to Marseilles. At each of these places a halt was
made when rations for the next stage of the journey were drawn,
and hot tea prepared by permanent staffs stationed on the
route was issued. Although halts sometimes were made in the
middle of the night, most men were lured from their uncomfortable
beds in spite of the cold nights to drink the hot tea.</p>

<p>The weather though cold was bright, and while daylight
lasted everyone drank in the beauty of the French scenery,
especially while passing along the valley of the Rhone, with its
wonderful river scenes and terraced vineyards, which clothed
the rugged slopes of the valley. Marseilles was reached on the
17th of November, after a journey of just over two days, and the
Battalion marched to the Rest Camp on the western outskirts
of the city. Here it poured constantly, and the whole camp
was a veritable quagmire; fortunately the stay was a short one,
for on the 19th November, 1916, half the Battalion marched to
the Docks, and boarded the <i>Transylvania</i>, one of the large
Transatlantic liners, at 11.0 a.m., bound for Salonica, while
the other half followed in the <i>Megantic</i>, a week later.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX<br />

<span class="medium">THE VOYAGE TO SALONICA&mdash;MALTA&mdash;SALONICA, 30TH NOVEMBER, 1916&mdash;JOURNEY TO KATERINA&mdash;OUTPOSTS AT STIPI.</span></h2>

<p>H.M. Troopship <i>Transylvania</i>, which was unfortunately sunk
by torpedo a few weeks later, set sail from Marseilles at midnight
on the 19th November. A rough sea was encountered, and it
was afterwards learnt that a tidal wave had swept over the
harbour that night, destroying a great amount of shipping.
The next day all was calm, and the officers and men of the
Battalion became accustomed to their new surroundings, and
acquainted with the interior of this huge vessel. Boat drill
was the novelty, but even this soon became a “bore,” and after
the first few parades everybody looked upon the compulsory life-belt
attached to one’s body as a millstone, rather than the
reverse. On the 20th, the islands of Corsica and Sardinia were
passed about 4 p.m., and on the following day the vessel steamed
along the north coast of Africa. During these days the calm
Mediterranean lulled all into a sense of peace and security,
and only when the three blasts of the ship’s syren disturbed the
quietness and everyone bustled to their boat stations did one
realise the possibility of enemy submarines spoiling the trip.
It is said that R.S.M. Freemantle gained a handsome monetary
reward for spotting a submarine, but the fact that only the
R.S.M. saw it causes doubts in many minds. Regardless of
any submarine reported to have been seen by the R.S.M., the
<i>Transylvania</i> was ordered by its escort of torpedo boat
destroyers to put into St. Paul’s Bay, Malta, on the morning of
the 22nd November, and about midday on the 24th, the liner
proceeded into the harbour of Valetta. This harbour is one of
the most wonderful in the world, and has a very narrow, heavily
fortified entrance leading from the outer bay to the inner harbour,
which was full of shipping, while men-o’-war of all classes were
constantly passing in and out. The town itself is on the high
ground around, and was glistening white under the hot sun of
the Mediterranean, which poured down its rays from a cloudless
blue sky. During the night of the 24th, a slight mishap
occurred to the <i>Transylvania</i> and she broke from her moorings,
but the Battalion slept on under the protection of the submarine-forbidden
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
harbour, unaware of any possible disaster. It was
not until the 27th that the word to proceed was given by the
Naval authorities, and a few days’ stay at Valetta had been
thoroughly enjoyed by those members of the Battalion (officers
and N.C.O.’s only, I am afraid), who were permitted ashore.
A route march through the town had been arranged for the
troops, but unfortunately this had to be cancelled on the receipt
of orders to sail.</p>

<p>The journey was continued from Malta without event, and
on the 29th November we passed the islands of the Greek
Archipelago, the names of which were always in dispute and
finally were dubbed with nicknames such as Enos, Kolynos,
Thermos, Chaos, and so on. When nearing Salonica several
hospital ships, which had been ruthlessly torpedoed, were just
visible above the water where they had been beached. The
next day, the 30th, the harbour of Salonica was reached, and
the Battalion disembarked on the quay during the morning.
From the harbour the town of Salonica looked very fine, and
extends from the green slopes of the hills on the east along a
flat stretch of some five miles to the low dismal country at the
foot of the Greek mountains. The town is dotted with mosques
and oriental churches, and the famous White Tower on the
promenade forms a striking contrast to the low shops and hotels
which line the harbour front. However, all this apparent
beauty was soon dispelled, and the mud and smell of even the
main thoroughfares was simply indescribable. On the quayside
hundreds of troops, French, Serbians, Russians and Greeks, were
shouting and making the harbour a babel of foreign tongues.
The route taken by the Battalion lay through the western end
of the town, and the curious shops with their gaily-dressed,
though ragged, merchants caused much comment among the
troops. Slow, lumbering oxen wagons formed the local method
of transport, and these, intermixed with the heavy army motor
lorries, caused considerable congestion. After the jumble of
traffic through streets a foot deep in mud and filth, the Battalion
was relieved to strike the main high road for Dudular. All along
this road were signs of military activity; ordnance stores, A.S.C.
dumps, motor lorry parks, and ammunition depots lined the
route, and a few miles from the town the Battalion passed two
extensive canvas general hospitals. Through this military city,
which had sprung up with mushroom-like growth during the war,
a railway had been built, and it struck one as being extremely
humorous to see a green engine with L.S.W.R. in golden letters
on its side puffing along under the control of the R.E. drivers.
What visions of Waterloo and leave trains! This line was
continued as far as Monastir, and troop trains of French and
Serbians constantly passed up and down. The camp was finally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
reached after a march of about eight miles, and was situated on
barren, desolate ground, which extended from a chain of hills
to the marshes along the Salonica-Monastir Road. On this
plain the whole Division was concentrated under a huge canvas
camp. The ground was rough, uneven, stony and cut by
numerous “nullahs.” Every one pitched his tent wherever
the geographical and geological conditions permitted, and it is
regretted that the beautiful straight lines of tents that distinguished
our camp at Saffron Walden were no longer to be seen.
Natives wandered around the camp and were promptly dubbed
“hoojahs,” a word which was attached to all things Greek for
want of a better descriptive word. These natives presumably
desired to sell their fruits and wares, but judging by their mixed
uniform of khaki and native garb it was doubtful whether
“scroungeing” was not their real intention. On the few more
level spots that were available football commenced, and for the
first few days life was enjoyable. Letters were again allowed,
and in spite of drills and parades it was a most restful time by
day. Night time, however, was disturbed by the inroads upon
the tired flesh of the troops by numerous “minor horrors of
war,” which had been encouraged to life by the blankets and
conditions generally on board the transport ship. Changes of
underclothes were issued and washing in the muddy streams
somewhat arrested the unpleasantness. This period was a
particularly busy one for the Quartermaster’s Stores, and stores
and equipment peculiar to the East were issued, among which
were bivouac sheets. Each man having been presented, gratis
by the thoughtful authorities, with a small khaki canvas sheet
about a yard square, together with a pole 2 feet 6 inches long,
two tent pegs and a piece of stout cord, bivouac parades were
instituted. The erection of a bivouac was not an easy matter
on such stony ground, and even when erected (sometimes by the
aid of bayonets and entrenching tools, the use of which was
soon forbidden) the open end provided little comfort from the
cold winds which blew from the hills at night. To add to this
discomfort, heavy torrential rains poured down on the 8th
December, and bivouacs fell down on their occupants during the
night with alarming rapidity, even the bell tents which remained
were rooted from their moorings, and an unpleasant night was
spent. The ground soon became a quagmire, and in the
nullahs streams of brown, muddy water rushed along. The
colour of the water used for cooking and making tea was of the
same delightful solidity, and there was little difference between
the tea before and after brewing. However, the weather
improved slightly, and the next item of interest was the arrival
of over 100 mules for the transport section, “straight from the
nest” as it were, and with no decorous idea of military discipline.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
The Quartermaster’s Stores was full of pack saddlery absolutely
new, slippery and unpliable, and the following day “Bill Bailey’s
Circus” was in full swing. The transport section, under Second
Lieutenant F. T. Bailey, was supplemented by fatigue parties
from the Battalion, until each mule had nearly a dozen attendants,
all of whom were absolutely necessary. The mules were then
dressed in their new kit by the untiring energies of the transport
section and their co-opted fatigues and paraded for the Commanding
Officer’s inspection. This, however, did not last for many
minutes; objections were raised, not forgetting the hind legs,
by the four-footed members of the transport, and “saddles
reversed” was soon performed. It was infectious, and half the
animals soon left the arena with kits incomplete, or at least in
quite the wrong places on their bodies. Finally the parade,
or rather what was left, was dismissed, and then followed the
counting of the mules, several of which had escaped. This,
however, did not disturb the Transport Officer, he calmly
remarking, “They will turn up at feeding time.” The next
morning a recount was made, and apparently the mules had
decided with which Regiment in the Brigade they would be
billeted. Exchanges were made and, needless to say, the
receiver was never the chooser. On the following day, after
another wet night when the mule lines had become a horrible
mixture of muddy transport men, mules and saddlery, the
Battalion, complete with transport, was ordered to parade for
a route march, apparently not so much for the benefit of the
troops, but as a test for the endurance of “Bill Bailey’s Circus.”
The mules were “dressed up” and the saddles loaded with
panniers, etc., and after a considerable delay the Battalion
started along the road. A few paces was sufficient to bring
about a debacle in the column; packs slipped, and the men were
detailed to fall out and reload the mules. Every yard of the
route was strewn with loads of all descriptions, many of which
had, no doubt, been unevenly weighted. The plain was dotted
with muleteers chasing after mutinous mules which had dispensed
with their encumbrances and taken flight. How many mules
finished the march is not recorded, but sufficient to say the march
proved amusing if nothing else. The next few days were spent
in scraping mud and salving blankets, waterproof sheets,
equipment and saddlery, which had been mislaid in the mud
that followed the heavy rain each night. On the Sunday,
10th December, a Brigade route march was ordered, and we were
inspected by our new Brigadier, General F. M. Edwards, C.M.G.,
who had taken the place of Brigadier-General Baird, who had
remained in France.</p>

<p>The same afternoon secret orders were received, and by midnight
the Battalion, less its transport, was marching to Salonica
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
Docks. After a few hours’ wait on the quayside, the Battalion
embarked on board H.M. torpedo boat destroyer <i>Mosquito</i>, and
set sail for somewhere in Greece. Accommodation was very
limited, and the black smoke from the funnels of the boat soon
covered every one with soot. The officers and crew of the
destroyer did all in their power to secure the maximum amount
of comfort for the troops, and the whole of the Battalion officers
were given an excellent breakfast in the small ward room.
During the afternoon the Greek coast was approached, and in
the distance we could see the snow clad peaks of the Olympus
group. The destroyer anchored a few hundred yards from land,
and parties of the Battalion were sent ashore in the small boats.
Great credit is due to the Naval folk for their handling of these
boats, and, with the exception of a few hasty members who
jumped ashore out of the boats too soon, no mishap occurred,
and with a cheer from both arms of the Service the destroyer left
for sea. The Battalion lined up on the beach at a place called
Scala Vromeris. The weather was glorious and the wet clothes
of the unfortunates were soon dried. Small fires were made on
the beach and a frugal meal was partaken. Scala Vromeris
consisted of a few wooden huts, and apparently was the “port,”
or rather the landing place, of the town of Katerina, which lay
a few miles inland. Only a few Greeks were in occupation,
and a large party of Maltese, working under some French soldiers,
were housed in the small huts. Orders were received to march
inland, leaving a rear party of about 50 men to await the arrival
of stores from Salonica. The march was along a genuine “Greek”
road, the chief constituents of which were mud, holes, ruts and
large stones, but the route was without steep gradients, and the
town of Katerina was reached early in the evening. This was a
typical Grecian country town, and the natives thronged the
streets half in fear and half in jubilation on the arrival of the
troops. On the further side of the town was a large Turkish
barracks, and here the Battalion was billeted. Men soon made
purchases at the shops of very inferior tasteless cigarettes, but
nuts and fruit were of excellent quality, though the prices were
somewhat exorbitant. A party of officers found their way into
a “caf&eacute;,” but when one realises that the plates were returned
three times to the washer-up before they could be accepted for
eating purposes, the quality of this “caf&eacute;” can be better appreciated.
Like the rest of the town and its people it was extremely
filthy.</p>

<p>The next day was spent in cleaning up the barracks, which
afterwards reached a state of comparative comfort in spite of
the broken windows and damaged floors. The day was peaceful
enough, but when the day’s rations of bully beef and biscuits
had been eaten every one wondered where the next meal was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
coming from. Neither the stores from Scala Vromeris nor the
Battalion transport had yet arrived. The town itself had been
practically exhausted of its eatables, and finally the question
was settled by means of “local purchase.” A flock of sheep was
bought by the Brigade, and mutton was issued to the men, but
even fresh killed mutton stewed in mess-tins does not make a
very substantial day’s feed for hungry troops. The Battalion,
however, managed to “scrounge,” and a few additions were
obtained privately from a French Quartermaster’s stores located
in one part of the barracks, and these helped to eke out the meagre
rations. It was a couple of days afterwards before the Battalion
transport, which had taken an overland route from Salonica,
arrived, and stores also arrived from the shore, though in the
meantime it had been necessary to eat our “iron rations.”
Both the transport and the stores’ escort had their special
adventures.</p>

<p>At Salonica the Battalion stores had been loaded on flat
lighters, which had proceeded to Scala Vromeris in tow of tugs.
Heavy seas were encountered and many of the lighters broke loose
and some drifted back to Salonica, while others, with half their
cargo washed overboard, fought their way to Scala Vromeris.
Those that landed back at Salonica proceeded under better
conditions a day or so later, and on arrival were soon unloaded
by the fatigue party we had left on the sea-shore. Much,
however, was lost at sea, including officers’ valises, mess boxes,
cooks’ gear, spare saddlery, Lewis gun panniers, ammunition,
blankets, etc., but what remained was carted from the shore
to Katerina by the aid of local ox-waggons, which lumbered
along at a snail’s pace.</p>

<p>The Battalion transport, which had travelled overland from
Dudular Camp near Salonica, left there the same evening as the
Battalion, and had been brigaded with the transport of the other
units in the 179th Brigade, and had been escorted on the route
by mounted troops. The journey was not a happy one, and they
had only moved at night for purposes of secrecy. This fact alone
made travelling difficult, but the wet weather multiplied their
troubles threefold. The roads were heavy and badly made,
mere tracks across waste land, and maps were indistinct and
even incorrect. Many of these tracks were built up above the
level of the surrounding country, and so heavy were the floods
that the water covered these roadways, and frequently pairs of
mules were struggling in the water at the roadside sometimes
five feet deep. When the catastrophes happened there was
nothing to be done but to cut off the load and give it a watery
grave; no attempt to salve them was possible or even desirable
in the darkness. On one of these occasions, when mules and
muleteer were thrown into the deeper water, an artillery officer,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
at great personal risk, dived in and saved the mule driver’s life,
and Private Phillips, of our own transport section, was highly
commended for his assistance, while the officer later received the
Silver Medal of the Royal Humane Society for saving life.
However, all is well that ends well, and the various parties of the
Battalion which had set out from Salonica by different routes
reunited at Katerina, but as a result of their respective adventures
huge deficiency lists were prepared. For the next week
the whole Battalion was employed on road making, and other
Battalions assisted the R.E. parties to repair the embankment
of the coastal railway from Salonica to Lharrisa, which had been
washed away in many places. It was not long afterwards that
the deserted railway station we had passed on the way from the
coast became a centre of activity. Ration trains arrived daily
from Salonica, and a large dump of stores and ammunition was
formed at Katerina Station. The Army Service Corps and
Royal Engineers did great work, and soon rations, letters, and
stores appeared with unfailing regularity from the Base. The
Brigade soon established itself comfortably at Katerina, and
even the local residents appreciated the situation and replenished
their stores with foodstuffs, wines and cigarettes.</p>

<p>A word must also be said in praise of the N.C.O.’s and men of
the French contingent in this area. They did all they could to
welcome the Britishers, and dinner parties were held nightly
in the Turkish barracks in our honour, probably to the detriment
of the French ration supply, but that was beside the point;
“a short life and a gay one” was their motto. After dinner,
songs in English and French were sung, toasts were drunk and
friendships made. These convivial evenings will live long in
the minds of those who participated.</p>

<p>On the 20th December, 1916, the Battalion marched out to
Stipi, a few miles south of Katerina, to take over an outpost line
which had been held by the Queen’s Westminsters since our
arrival in this part of Greece. The march was over rough
country, and the additional kit in the shape of bivouac sheets,
waterproofs, blankets, winter clothing and cardigans, extra
bandoliers of ammunition fairly broke the backs of the men.</p>

<p>“A,” “C” and “D” Companies relieved the outpost line,
and “B” Company, with Headquarters, Transport, and Quartermaster’s
Stores were kept in reserve. The outpost line was
along the low ridge of hills which ran from Stipi to Kundariotisa,
and strict orders were issued that no movement on the skyline
should be made by day. Bivouac camps were therefore erected
on the reverse or northern slopes which ran down to the grassy
valley of the River Mavourneri. From the southern slopes of
this ridge the panorama was wonderful, a flat stretch of country
for some twenty miles could be seen in the direction of Lharrisa,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
so that observation from the defences was perfect. On the
further side of the plain rose the gigantic chain of snow-capped
peaks, of which Mount Olympus formed a massive centrepiece.
This mountain wall cut off the Katerina area from the rest of
Southern Greece. Only by way of the narrow seashore plain
and through the famous Petras Pass on the west of Katerina
could the south be reached. At this time the attitude of Greece
towards the Allies was questionable, and the position taken up
by the Brigade was to secure the base at Salonica from any
attack that might have been made from the south.</p>

<p>The Battalion employed itself now in commencing to dig a
defensive line on the southern slopes of the ridge, and trench-digging
in this part of the world was extremely laborious, as the
ground was practically solid rock.</p>

<p>Barbed wire was not obtainable, and for the purpose of obstacles
thick zarebas of short, stiff, prickly thorn bushes which covered
the hill-side were used for entanglements. In our spare time
football was played, and platoon and company competitions were
soon in full swing. A splendid flat field had been cleared near
the river bank, and was the scene of many exciting struggles.
Christmas was approaching, and funds were collected for additional
luxuries. The canteen opened by Brigade at Katerina was
insufficient to supply the extra needs for the festive season,
and Lieutenant Andrew and an able assistant were sent to
Salonica by rail, where a Base Canteen was successfully attacked,
and on Christmas Eve large supplies of Christmas goods arrived;
not so much in quantity as we should have liked, but considering
the difficulties of transport, Lieutenant Andrew was to be
congratulated. Chicken and eggs were purchased from the local
villages of Stipi and Kundariotisa, and altogether a happy
Christmas was spent in the bivouacs. Christmas decorations
were numerous and consisted chiefly of grey-back shirts and
underclothing which had become unpleasant to wear and decked
the surrounding thorn bushes.</p>

<p>The festival of Christmas was celebrated by the local residents,
and I had the pleasure of accompanying the Commanding
Officer to the village of Stipi, where the chief man of the village
bade us enter his house. Here we were ushered into the best
room and seated on mats on the floor while the daughters of the
house, in gay dresses, waited upon us, bringing in coffee, aniseed
liqueur and apple jelly as refreshments. Conversation was
carried on through the medium of the heir to the house, who had
picked up a smattering of French in Salonica, where he was
employed.</p>

<p>For the men sing-songs were arranged and sports were held, but
the festivities of Christmas soon ceased, and the work on the
trenches was resumed. New Year celebrations were limited to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
an excellent concert given in the Turkish barracks at Katerina
by the French soldiers, and those who were privileged to attend
thoroughly enjoyed their efforts.</p>

<p>The weather continued fairly fine, though spells of heavy rain,
and sometimes snow, fell, making life in small canvas “bivvies”
rather miserable. The Battalion remained on this outpost line
for just over six weeks, during which time a strong defensive
line facing Lharrisa had been built, and this was continued to
the coast on the left flank by a series of strong points built and
manned by the Westminsters. Road making and bridge building
were carried on by the reserve Company, and I am sure the local
Greeks must have appreciated our efforts, which resulted in the
many military roads connecting Katerina with the surrounding
villages. Occasionally field days were held by the Brigade,
the rendezvous always being the Tumulus, which was an ever-present
landmark for miles around our position. Kit inspections
were frequent, and the losses of equipment, etc., resulting from
our journey from Salonica led to lengthy sittings of a Board of
Enquiry, and consequently many entries were made in pay books
for loss of kit. In our spare time we played football after the
day’s work, and keen competitions between platoons and companies
resulted. Matches were arranged with the other Regiments
in the Brigade, in which the Civil Service came through with
considerable credit. For the benefit of officers a riding class,
under the Medical Officer, Dr. J. W. Leech (John Willie to all his
friends) was instituted, and the quality of riding in the Battalion
greatly improved. While referring to John Willie’s equestrian
ability, one must not overlook his medical skill. His sick parade
each morning was divided into two classes; one from the Battalion
and the other from the local villages, which brought their sick
for attention. Frequently the Doctor was called out to a village
to attend an invalid, and among the natives his skill was considered
wonderful; not that I infer the Battalion did not
appreciate his efforts, for his droll manner and Irish humour
were characteristics we all loved, and his attention to all ranks
was without fault. The only difference was that the natives
presented him with fowls, fruit and small gifts, whereas the
unfortunate recipient of a No. 9 offered his thanks in words alone.
When a man was beyond the curative powers of a No. 9 or its
brother pills he was transferred to the Field Ambulance, which had
been established at Katerina. The country around was rough,
and was only traversed by mule tracks, so that it was impossible
to bring motor ambulances up as far as the Regimental Aid Post.
The lying cases were, therefore, taken to hospital by means of a
strange vehicle drawn by a mule. This vehicle simply consisted
of two long poles some twenty feet in length which were attached
to the mule after the manner of shafts, while the ends dragged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
on the ground behind the mule. These two poles were secured
to each other in rear of the mule, and the stretcher was fixed
resting between the poles, so that the patient’s head was higher
than his feet. Whether this was a comfortable means of transit
must be left to the judgment of the victims, but undoubtedly
it was the most suitable means in those parts.</p>

<p>No mention hitherto has been made of “Peter,” who was
appointed Battalion interpreter. He was an undersized Greek,
who loved the Regiment, and no doubt worked very hard in the
“Grecian way,” and although no one understood his parleys
with the local natives when we wished to dig up their land for
trenches, it is believed that he coerced them by the authority
given to him by the wearing of the Prince of Wales’s feather in
his cap. He loved the Battalion better than his countrymen.</p>

<p>About the middle of February the Battalion left the outpost
line at Stipi, and two Companies, “A” and “B” proceeded to
Katerina barracks together with Headquarters Company,
Transport, and Quartermaster’s Stores. The other two Companies,
under the command of Major A. A. Oliver, moved to
Kolukuri, a few miles west of Katerina, and erected their bivouacs
in Shrine Woods. Here a flank defensive line was held by night
posts. From the 15th of February until the 28th the Battalion
remained in these stations, and the only excitement which broke
the monotony of the life was the visit of a strange aeroplane,
which flew over the square at Katerina barracks. No one
understood its mission and gazed at it curiously, for underneath
its wings were two large blue crosses and not the black Maltese
cross used on German aeroplanes. After it had taken note of
everything it flew away; no one fired at it, and no one to this
day knows the meaning of this “mystery” plane. Orders from
Brigade to fire at it came later on, but by that time the plane
was well out of the range of our field guns.</p>

<p>On the 28th of February the Battalion concentrated on the
main road near Kolukuri on the way to the Petras Pass and
proceeded up towards the Pass, where a strong defensive position
had been held since our arrival in December by the London
Scottish. The Battalion halted at Kalivia Miljas for the night,
and the most unpleasant night it proved to be with the heavy
rains. The following day orders were received to return to
Katerina, and the Battalion marched back again as far as the
banks of the River Mavourneri, just outside the town. In flood
time the river is over a mile in width, but at other times it
dwindles down to a fast stream only 40 to 50 feet wide. It
was on the rough, dry sandy bed of the river that the whole
Brigade was encamped, and here preparations for a long trek
were made. The weather was fine, but the strong winds that
blew and raised sandstorms made it an unpleasant resting place,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
and no one regretted the order to move, which was received on
the 9th of March.</p>

<p>Before ending this chapter on our stay in Macedonia, the
following letter, written from Greece, might prove interesting:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Macedonia is a lovely country, and the lack of reading matter
a considerable hardship. It is a land of bare treeless valleys,
strongly reminiscent of the Veldt and high snow-clad spurs of the
Balkans. Of the people, the less said perhaps the better. St. Paul
in old time was of the opinion that the Thessalonians were ‘lewd
persons of the baser sort,’ or words to that effect, and my experience
is that they have not improved by keeping in the interim. A
motley mixture of Turks and Bulgars with a smattering of Greeks,
they are undoubtedly picturesque in garb, more undoubtedly
filthy in person and habits, and most undoubtedly the finest collection
of thieves, brigands and cut-throats that could be brought
together. When the brigandage business is slack, as at present,
they apparently fill in their spare time as herdsmen and shepherds.
We are employing considerable numbers in road making and the
other day I heard the following: A party of Greeks came along
towards our transport, and one bright youth on sighting them lifted
up his voice to his chum, ‘Look out, Jack! Here comes Ali Baba
and his forty &mdash;&mdash; thieves.’</p>

<p>“The days are hot and the nights bitterly cold, while at times a
terrifically strong and piercing wind, called the Vardar blast, blows
from the Balkans. Taken altogether the majority of us heartily
wish ourselves back in France.”</p></blockquote>

<span class="medium">LEAVING KATERINA&mdash;TREK TO THE DOIRAN FRONT&mdash;KARASULI NIGHT</span></h2>

<p>On the 10th of March, 1917, reveille was at an early hour, and by
eight o’clock in the morning the 179th Brigade had formed up in
column of route together with the Artillery, Royal Engineers,
Machine Gun Corps, and Army Service Corps detachments which
had joined it since its arrival at Katerina in December, 1916.
The whole town turned out to bid us farewell, and the local band
played appropriate music in the market place. Flags decked the
low-built houses of the town, and the people of Katerina were
sorry to lose the Brigade which, during its short stay, poured
thousands of “drachmas” into the town coffers, turning indolence
and poverty into business and wealth. The French Commandant
also did honour to the British troops and furnished a strong guard
of honour, which gallantly stood at the “Present” while the
Brigade passed by. The first day of the march was to a place
called Tuzla, near the coast some ten miles north of Katerina,
and although ten miles on a good English road is a small journey,
the badly cut-up roads of Greece and the heavy kit the men were
carrying made the journey appear to be twice its actual distance.
Mules were loaded to their fullest capacity, and many loads
slipped off, causing disorganisation on the march. Eventually,
after about five hours’ marching, the Brigade reached the night’s
bivouac area, where a terrific cold wind was blowing from the
sea. However, “bivvies” were erected and a meal prepared,
and every one retired for the night, wondering what the next
day would bring.</p>

<p>Every one was astir early the following morning, and after an
early breakfast the camp was packed up. Then the real fun of
the day commenced; this was the loading of the mules. Although
I have not yet described this performance in detail it might
interest those who did not actually participate in the trek.
Loads were arranged and specially lashed with strong ropes.
The great art was to prepare loads in pairs, each of which was of
equal weight. Of course, with such articles as blankets, Lewis
gun panniers, ammunition boxes, where an equal number solved
the difficulty it was an easy matter; but when it came to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
question of cooks’ gear, pioneer tools, officers’ valises, and so on,
it developed into a matter of either exceeding great skill or pure
luck. Having thus made up two loads of equal weight and
examined the mule’s girth, the muleteer would stand at the
animal’s head and say nice things to it with a view of taking its
attention from the loads. Two men would then stand on either
flank of the beast and lift the loads, with the intention of hooking
them on to the saddle by the rings attached to the lashing ropes.
The loading on both sides had to be performed simultaneously,
or otherwise the weight on one side only simply twisted the saddle
under the mule, annoying the animal to such an extent that it
would immediately kick out and break loose, dashing about
with the load under its stomach. Such escapades on the part of
the mules were all too frequent; the mules hated the loads, and
to add to the difficulties of the performance commenced to dance
a “tango” on the feet of the unfortunate fatigue men trying to
persuade it to carry a couple of heavy side loads. Towards the
end of this trek, however, the men became aware of this side-stepping
by the mules, and eventually experts in each Company
developed, and the balancing of the loads, the synchronisation
of the hooking-on process, became matters of skill as the result
of sad experience.</p>

<p>From Tuzla the line of march was to Livanovan, and as a
contrast to the very cold wind of the previous day the sun poured
down, and the journey of twelve miles was over the same badly-made
roads, while steep gradients were also encountered. On
the 12th of March the Brigade proceeded to Gida, a further
distance of twelve miles. On arrival a flat piece of ground was
found for the camp. On the march each man carried a few
pieces of stick or wood from ration boxes, and at the end of the
day’s march a supply of wood for fires was immediately ready on
arrival in camp. During this trek great credit was due to the
cooks, both in the companies and the officers’ messes, for the
splendid way in which they immediately set to and prepared
meals for their expectant clients at the end of the day’s march.
I know that at Gida, Evison (“D” Company’s mess cook) and
his batman pals had so trained themselves that on the arrival
of their Company Officers from the men’s lines, after seeing the
mules unloaded and the men settled down, a splendid meal of
fried eggs and bacon, biscuits and butter, tea, and Welsh rarebit
was spread on the mess table-cloth. (“D” Company always
boasted of this cloth, regardless of its doubtful snowy whiteness
at times.)</p>

<p>The next day, the 13th of March, was very trying
owing to the great heat and the distance covered, just over
20 miles. A midday halt was made on that part of the road
where the transport section had had such a disastrous time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
on their journey from Salonica in December, and the mule
drivers regaled every one with the horrible details of their
experiences. The roads were being improved near the town
of Topscin by parties of Bulgar prisoners under French guards.
As the column approached Topscin village the sounds of music
greeted it. The town was in the hands of the French, and
their band had turned out to welcome us. The “Marseillaise”
and “God Save the King” were rendered alternately while
the whole Brigade marched by.</p>

<p>Just after leaving Topscin we crossed the Vardar River, and
a couple of miles beyond, the new camping ground was reached;
but the rain which had then set in made the arrival miserable.
It was then 6.0 p.m. and every one was dead-beat, but an issue
of rum livened us up a little.</p>

<p>The following morning bivouacs were struck and the march
resumed as far as Amantovo, a distance of 14 miles, and it was
during this march that the first man of the Battalion fell out,
and only the excessive heat caused him to faint, showing how
splendidly he had stuck to it. The camp at Amantovo was
on soft, grassy ground, and the pegs of our bivouacs were driven
in with ease, a change after the stony nature of our previous
camping grounds. The last part of the day’s march had been
over grassy downs, and the beautiful weather made it enjoyable.
To add to the happiness, however, there was a surprise in store;
a ration of oranges was issued that night. The next day’s
march was to be performed in two parts. The start was made
about 8.0 a.m., and the route lay through pleasant valleys and
over undulating grassland. A few miles from Amantovo the
Battalion marched past the Commander-in-Chief of our forces
in Salonica, General Sir G. F. Milne, K.C.B., and his staff. The
General was greatly impressed with the fitness of the Battalion.</p>

<p>About midday a halt was called and cooking commenced.
Plenty of water, duly chlorinated, of course, was drawn from
the local streams. In the afternoon small card parties were
made up in the Battalion, others slept, while others read novels;
each man in some sections carried a small sevenpenny novel,
and by exchanging there was plenty to read. Just ahead of
the Battalion was a tumulus, and from this point it was said
that the “line” could be seen, but of course it was forbidden
ground. The progress of the Battalion having been thus barred,
we settled down to a very pleasant, restful afternoon in the
warm sunshine, little dreaming of the eccentricities of the
Macedonian springtime.</p>

<p>At twilight the order was given to move off, and with darkness
came rain, and such cold rain, too! The wind sprang up and
the first few miles were spoilt by “concertina work” by the
column, a most dreaded thing for infantrymen with a heavy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
kit. However, after the first halt the movement of the column
settled down and became more tolerable; but accidents to
the mules soon disorganised the column again and connection
in the dark became difficult. The Battalion floundered on
through mud and slush over what must have been ploughed
land, I think. Mules now began to fall out with unfailing
regularity and men were constantly detailed from the ranks
to reload them, and a very straggling column resulted. No
one seemed to be certain of the way over this strange country
in the pitch darkness. No one appeared to have a watch, either,
for no halts were called; certainly the ground was too thick
in wet mud for halting purposes, but after three hours marching
over such ground in pouring rain all infantrymen felt the strain.
Onwards the Battalion struggled, mile after mile, through this
awful morass of mud and the pelting rain. Every one longed
for a halt, but this was not to be; not until the Battalion arrived
on the outskirts of Karasuli did that precious whistle break
the silence. Then every one just sat down in the middle of
the road. The men had marched for six hours without a halt
or even taking off their packs. Remarkable to relate, the
number of men who fell out was practically nil; there were no
estaminets here, and to fall out would mean a lonely night in
the desolate wilds of northern Greece; and this was an unpleasant
prospect. At Karasuli a fairly long halt was made
and spirits revived, but being under enemy observation no
smoking was allowed; this was the last straw, and the Hun
and his Allies had curses heaped upon their heads that night,
if ever. Rumour that the final halt was only a few hundred
yards ahead helped to improve matters, but even this flicker of
hope was damped by the heavy rain that constantly poured
down. The whistle sounded again, and off the Battalion moved,
though no one knows the route taken to this day. Brigade
staff certainly did its utmost to sort out the mixed column
of men, mules and transport of all regiments.</p>

<p>The country here was broken by deep gullies or “nullahs”
along which the water rushed in torrents. For over an hour the
Battalion staggered along over the broken ground, one moment
stumbling down a steep rugged bank of a nullah, the next
crawling on hands and knees up the slippery bank opposite,
and frequently wading nearly waist deep in water. About
1.0 a.m. the Battalion halted. Rain had fallen for hours and
the ground was churned up into a quagmire, but a halt, even
in these surroundings, was welcome. Men threw off their packs
and, in spite of their weariness and exhaustion, it was to be
admired that all the mules, which had also struggled through
this terrible journey, were immediately unloaded. Kits, rifles
and mule loads had been thrown on the ground by the overwrought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
men, and some just lay down from sheer fatigue;
others stood in the bitter cold and awaited the dawn. Some
of the more energetic dared to put up their bivouacs, but soon
gave up the idea of sleeping owing to the terrific cold wind
that blew. Those who were able to move were issued with rum,
but I am afraid that owing to the difficulties of the situation
and the fact that many men had fallen into a delirious sleep
it was unequally divided, and in the darkness it was difficult
to discern whether a staggering man was the outcome of too
much marching or too much rum. Towards dawn the downpour
ceased a little, but the shivering troops, mud from head
to foot, still stood in the withering clutches of the Vardar blast,
and one man remarked, looking at the surrounding swamp,
“Guess I’m standing in the Blasted Vardar, too!” Gradually
daylight appeared, and what a scene&mdash;drenched men, cold,
miserable, hungry and tired. The sick parade was extremely
large that morning. Many had become so exhausted that they
had laid down in the wet mud during the night and the next
morning were, of course, physical wrecks; others had reached
a state of delirium and wandered about bereft of their senses,
and mention has already been made of the third group, the
men who had “really” got the rum. The balance of the
Battalion simply felt done up. However, all those who had
not been sent to the field hospitals at Karasuli set to work and
dragged from beneath the mud, rifles, equipment, bivouac sheets
and remnants of the mules’ loads, and sorted them into dumps.
The sun shone and life appeared possible, even if not desirable,
in this wilderness of mud. About midday the Quartermaster’s
Stores sent fatigue parties to an A.S.C. dep&ocirc;t a mile or so away,
and fresh meat and rations were issued. Small fires were soon
started and the old “gyppa” was on the boil. Every one
looked forward to a nice hot meal, when orders for an immediate
move were received. One can pass over this scene without
expressing the views of the troops; it can well be imagined how
pleasing it was to see the half-cooked “gyppa” poured away
into the mud, as the cooks’ gear had to be packed on the mules
at once.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the clank of the entrenching-tool handle
against the rifle butt and the rattle of the water bottle and other
impedimenta associated with troops on the march was heard.
The Battalion moved off with Platoons at intervals of 100 yards.
The road from Karasuli was in good condition and had dried
up under the warmth of the sun and the constant wind, but a
mile or so from the camping ground to that main road was
covered with deep nullahs and ravines. As we passed over it
we wondered how the Battalion had ever marched over such
ground the previous night. Once on the main road a decent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
step was taken and the troops felt the benefit of a good road,
and made headway. However, the wind renewed its violence
of the previous evening and blew into the face of the Battalion
so that the benefit of the better road was soon nullified by the
Vardar Blast. Clothing was still saturated with the rain of
the night before, and the cold wind simply pierced us to the
bones. Snow fell and added to the misery of things and soon
the country-side was white; to say nothing of the Father Christmas-like
appearance of the troops. When darkness came
things really became difficult and the march developed into a
hopeless plodding along, fighting against a biting cold head wind
the whole while. For the first nine miles the route was along
the main road, and the mules retained their loads with comparative
ease, and not like the previous day’s march when they
slipped and fell over on the treacherous muddy tracks.</p>

<p>So extreme was the cold that after each ten minutes halt
it was with difficulty that men rose from the ground; most of
them were frozen stiff. About 10.0 p.m. the head of the column
was seen crossing the rough ground on the left of the main road.
Hopes were raised, and if even a bivouac in the snow was an unpleasant
prospect, the ending of the march was some consolation.
Visions of a new camp were becoming plain, but when the
Battalion followed this column across the rough ground for
over an hour hopes were shattered.</p>

<p>From the roadway onwards men of all regiments in the Brigade
lined the route; floundering over the rough ground after a
stiff march had proved too much for even some of the stalwarts
who had braved the night at Karasuli. Transport limbers
and mules blocked the way, either stuck in the small nullahs
that crossed the route or else the animals had become too exhausted
to move. In fact, it was not an uncommon sight to
see dead mules on the ground, having succumbed to the extreme
cold, and when mules “gave up the ghost” it can be well judged
how the men suffered. No one had any fear of being lost this
night should he fall out; the route was well marked by deserted
limbers, dead mules and fallen loads. About midnight the
journey ended and the Brigade halted near the deserted farm
buildings which were occupied by the Headquarters of the
Brigade in the line. When the signal to halt was given every
one just sat down exhausted, but the lesson of the previous
night had been learnt, and little sleep was attempted. Small
fires were lighted and mess tins were brought out and tea was
made. “Scroungeing” parties went round and “won” blankets,
tarpaulins, etc., from wherever possible, regardless of the
Battalion or Company to which they belonged. Some officers,
by dint of hard work, had even erected a bell tent, having a
limber pole for its support. Whose tent and whose pole were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
never questioned. The night thus passed fairly quickly and
every one made the best of a bad job. The snow had ceased,
and it was, therefore, an improvement on the downpour twenty-four
hours previously. As soon as daylight came every one was
astir with the exception of the favoured few who had confiscated
a pile of officers’ valises and rigged up a temporary shanty.
However, their rest was soon disturbed and orders were given
to “fall in.” The day was brighter and this cheered us a little.
The Battalion soon marched off and soon sites were allotted to
Companies in the deep nullahs or ravines about 500 yards from
the deserted farm buildings. In the warmth of the sun, the
sheltered positions in the ravines soon made us forget the discomfort
of the night. The debris of the previous night was
collected and every one enjoyed a hot meal which the
cooks soon prepared. The afternoon was spent in rest and
sleep.</p>

<p>However, war is war, and there is no rest for the wicked.
The writer, together with another officer and some N.C.O.’s from
each Company, were detailed to go up to the line for reconnaissance
purposes that very afternoon. But even the darkest cloud
has its silver lining, and after a trudge of four miles the party
which had come over the skyline in twos and threes were welcomed
by the Headquarters of the London Irish (2/18th London
Regiment), and were soon detailed to Companies for the night.
It was the 17th of March, and the London Irishmen who had
been settled in the part of the line for some weeks celebrated
their patron Saint’s day in the proper style, and the requisite
canteen stores and drinks had been acquired. No one could
have been more hospitable, and the wretched advance party
which had left Kolonova that afternoon felt that the war was
not so bad as it might have been. Perhaps it would not be
out of place to mention here that one of the toasts drunk in the
Company dug-out where the writer was so kindly entertained
was “To our 1st Battalions, the 1st Civil Service Rifles and the
1st London Irish Rifles.” These Battalions were serving in
France with the 47th Division and had curiously left England
on St. Patrick’s Day in 1915. The 17th of March is “The day”
in the history of our 1st Battalion, but it has its place in the
history of the 2nd Battalion. It was the end of what is popularly
known as the “Karasuli Trek.”</p>

<p>During the past week the Battalion had marched from
Katerina, near Mount Olympus, to Kolonova, on the Doiran
Front; a distance of about 100 miles had been covered in seven
days. The march was over rough country the whole way.
Extremes of weather had been encountered during these few
days; from the hottest of Mediterranean suns at Livanovan
to the wettest of oriental rains at Karasuli, and to the bleakest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
of blizzards and snowstorms that the Balkan Heights at Kolonova
can produce. The man who was able to stick to his guns throughout
this trek can well boast, and only the terrible experiences
of the last two nights of the journey deprived many of the same
boast.

<span class="medium">ON THE DOIRAN-VARDAR FRONT&mdash;THE ADVANCE</span></h2>

<p>A short description of the situation on the Doiran-Vardar
sector of the Salonica Front will no doubt assist the reader
to better realise the type of operations peculiar to this theatre
of war. A few miles west of Lake Doiran was a mountainous
ridge running north and south, about five or six miles long, known
as “P” Ridge. This chain consisted of a series of five distinct
peaks, the southern one, “Pip 5,” being about 800 feet high,
while the remaining four progressively increased in altitude
until “Pip 1” at the northern end reached the height of about
1,700 feet (or 535 metres); this was the famous “535” which
dominated the country for many miles around, in fact on a clear
day the peak could be distinctly seen from the hills at Dudular
near Salonica, some 60 miles away. The Bulgar held practically
all this ridge of the “Pips” except at the lowest part at the
south, where the British had gained a footing. The Bulgar
was strongly entrenched on all the slopes of the ridge, and each
peak was an almost impregnable fortress in itself.</p>

<p>From the northern end the enemy lines ran due west along a
mountainous chain some 1,000 to 1,200 feet high through the
town of Devedzili, thence south of Paljorca to Pobreg. Just
east of Pobreg the line ran due south for some six miles along
another ridge of hills about 600 to 700 feet high which terminated
at the “Nose,” a fortified stronghold on the borders of Serbia
and Greece. From the “Nose” the enemy trenches were
situated on the hills just north of Macukova, finally having the
right flank on the banks of the Vardar at a point some four
miles from the “Nose.”</p>

<p>The British line ran from the southern extremity of the “P”
ridge in a south-westerly direction to the village of Bekerli,
from which point it ran practically due west to the Vardar,
where our lines were only about 1&frac12; miles from the enemy trenches.
The whole of the British line was on the low hills just north
of the Cidemli Dere, a valley through which a small stream of
about 20 feet in width bubbled along.</p>

<p>South of this stream the reserve British positions were situated
on the chain of the Kolonovan Heights (500 feet) which ran along
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
north of Ardzan, Smol and Karasuli. It will therefore be seen
that only on our flanks were we in close touch with the enemy;
on the left flank near the Vardar for about four miles east of
the river banks as far as Reselli opposite the “Nose” where
the enemy line turned north, and on the right flank at the foot
of the “P” ridge at its southern extremities south of the village
of Krastali. Even at these points the lines were at least a
mile apart. The remainder of “No Man’s Land” consisted of
a plain through which the ravine of the Selemli Dere formed a
definite line between the opposing parties. From this ravine
the ground was fairly flat for about 500 yards on each bank,
but it soon developed into a land of hillocks some hundred
feet above the level of the Selemli Dere plain, forming the foot-hills
up to the higher ground held by the two armies. In this
part of “No Man’s Land” were dotted the deserted villages
of Dautli, Selemli and Sejdelli. The enemy had taken up a
strong defensive line on the high ground which overlooked the
whole of the lesser hills on the southern side of the Selemli plain,
and his observation on our movements was therefore good.
Any movement by day on our part was restricted, and from
the commanding position of “P” ridge he could practically
look into our trenches which had been constructed on the forward
slopes of the small hills north of the Kolonovan Heights.
In daytime these trenches were therefore only held by a sentry
group, while the remainder of the garrison retired to the
small bivouac camps which had been dug in on the reverse
slopes.</p>

<p class="caption"><i><span class="smcap">Rough Sketch Map

Approximately the
situation on the
&mdash;&mdash;“Doiran-Vardar” front&mdash;&mdash;</span></i>
(<i>1917</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>By reference to the sketch map at the commencement of
this chapter it will be seen that no further advance on our part
was possible beyond the Bekerli Village Line, for from “Pip I”
the Bulgars could enfilade any camps that were pushed forward.
Not until the whole of the “Pip” ridge was gained could any
advance on the Vardar section be made.</p>

<p>The British Army had therefore to sit content on the line
of low hills, each of which was made into a strong point held by
a garrison at night and a sentry group by day. The whole
front was strongly wired and the ground or dip between these
hills held by a Lewis gun post, or sometimes a Vickers machine-gun
section. The wire had been cunningly arranged so that
all these re-entrants formed “culs de sac” into which heavy
machine-gun fire could be poured by the defenders.</p>

<p>During daytime no one disputed “No Man’s Land,” but at
night time strong patrols were sent out by both sides to obtain
the mastery, and prevent raids or surprise attacks on the defensive
lines that were held. Across the centre of “No Man’s
Land” was a line of large white stone pillars at regular intervals,
representing the frontier between Greece and Serbia; an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
interesting fact, though, of course, having no bearing on the
actual operations in this part of the world.</p>

<p>The British transport lines and ration dumps were behind
the cover of the Kolonovan Heights which ran parallel with
the main Karasuli-Kilindir Road which made communication
along the rear of our positions comparatively easy. From
the transport up to the line the journey was done at night time,
except in the case of individual runners, or perhaps two or
three men in a party, but so keen was the observation of the
Bulgar that even these small parties attracted the unpleasant
attention of a “pip-squeak” gun which had the tracks over
the ridge “taped” to a nicety.</p>

<p>On the 19th of March, 1917, the Battalion marched up to the
line from its bivouacs at Kolonova and took over from the
2/18th London Regiment (London Irish). All reliefs were
carried out by night and under cover of darkness the Battalion
left its sheltered camp, by Platoons at intervals. Every one
had been ordered to maintain silence and no smoking was allowed.
All the average man knew was the fact that somewhere over
the ridge at Kolonova was the line, how far or how near he was
never told, and the order for strict silence on the march led
him to believe that the enemy was fairly close to hand, although
in point of fact the Bulgar was comfortably settled in the dug-outs
of his mountain stronghold at least five miles ahead. Knowing
this fact the following incident on the march will be appreciated.
A nervous private recently joined approached his
Platoon Commander with a whisper, “Don’t you think that
officer on horseback ought to cover his luminous wrist watch?”
True, Major Oliver was in charge of the Battalion canteen, and
probably had first choice of the luminous Ingersolls that occasionally
came our way, but even the most luminous are not
guaranteed to dazzle the eyes at a distance of five miles. However,
such was the keenness of this rifleman to save his platoon
from a strafe by the enemy artillery.</p>

<p>For a whole month the Battalion held the line from Waggon
Hill, just east of Reselli village, to the village of Bekerli. On
our left was a battalion of the 180th Infantry Brigade, while
our neighbour on the right was the Queen’s Westminster Rifles
of our own Brigade. The Battalion front consisted of Waggon
Hill, which overlooked the Selemli Plain and the village of
Sejdelli in front, while the ground on the left flank was low
and formed a branch of the Selemli Ravine, and made a dangerous
entrance to the rear of our positions just opposite the “Nose.”
“D” Company occupied this hill, with “B” Company in
immediate support in the valley of the Cidemli Dere. The
right of the Battalion front was on the high ground near the
ruined village of Bekerli, and formed the angle from which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
British line ran north-east through Bastion Hill, Bowls Barrow,
Whaleback, Horse Shoe Hill to the foot of “Pip 5” on the “P”
ridge. “A” Company was responsible for the Bekerli defences,
with “C” Company in immediate reserve, while Battalion
Headquarters were farther back at Bekerli Ford, on the Cidemli
Dere. As previously stated, movement was restricted during
the daytime, which was spent in sleep, writing letters and card
playing, leavened, of course, by fatigues and working parties
for the improvements of dug-outs and similar work which could
be undertaken by day under cover of the hills. No movement
was allowed beyond an occasional runner to the support Companies
or Battalion Headquarters. At night time, however,
work commenced. The trenches were strongly garrisoned,
and sentry groups were posted along the wire, while still farther
out in “No Man’s Land,” about 500 yards from the wire, standing
patrols of an N.C.O. and 20 men were posted in order to prevent
the enemy from approaching our lines in force.</p>

<p>The support companies furnished large carrying parties to
bring up rations, letters and the <i>Balkan News</i>, a newspaper
specially printed in Salonica for British troops; all of which
arrived from the Quartermaster’s stores at Kulonova, about one
hour after dark. They also provided working parties to improve
the trenches, which for the most part had been blasted from
solid rock. Communication trenches were also made up to the
forward companies, care being taken to conceal them in the
numerous shallow dips in the ground as any sign of digging was
sure to be strafed the next day. All earth had to be removed,
as the smallest heap of soil above the level of the ground was
looked upon by the Bulgar as the commencement of a new gun
emplacement and consequently bombarded. There is no doubt
that the Bulgar took every advantage of his higher position, and
his observers were very keen, and this together with the wonderful
accuracy of his guns made us very careful to conceal all
signs of digging.</p>

<p>The support companies also furnished an officer’s patrol each
night of about 24 men strong. These fighting patrols had orders
to approach the enemy’s wire on the other side of the plain.
How different from the patrols of three or four men on the
Neuville St. Vaast front in France, where movement was very
restricted. On the Doiran front it became a nocturnal route
march. A few points were sent ahead and the main body
followed <i>en bloc</i>. Although instructions were issued to reach
the enemy’s wire it was rarely accomplished; Bulgar patrols
were always wandering about on the plain at night. In the
area allotted to our Battalion for patrol work were the two
villages of Dautli and Selemli, which were much nearer to the
enemy’s advanced posts than our own. To reach these villages
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
and search them was about the limit of our adventures. The
Bulgars were far too strong at this point, for here the Selemli
Dere could be crossed by tracks which the enemy jealously
guarded. Fortunately, though shots were sometimes exchanged
no serious fighting occurred to the 2/15th London patrols. On
the return journey towards daylight it was considered part of
the scheme to halt at the village of Sejdelli, near our lines, and
break down the woodwork in the houses already damaged by
shell fire and bring doorposts, window frames and so on back
into our lines for the cooks’ fire. It was most amusing to hear
the patrols heralding their safe return by loudly hammering on
the woodwork of Sejdelli. Never a Bulgar fell into the hands of
our patrols, but they always returned with plenty of wood.</p>

<p>Although in daytime it was not advisable to wander across
“No Man’s Land,” on one occasion our Intelligence Officer,
Lieutenant Andrew, and his batman, Private Joines, spent a
day searching the village of Dautli. They walked to the village
during the night and hid themselves at dawn in an empty house
to watch the movements of the enemy near the fords across the
Selemli Dere near by. Great was their surprise, however, when
a party of eight Bulgars appeared from the other side of the
village carrying some rabbits and hares. Discretion was the
better part of valour and Andrew and his batman decided to
keep quiet. After a few exciting minutes and by quietly sneaking
around the houses they were able to evade the enemy shooting
party, and spent the rest of the day quietly enough locating and
sketching the enemy forward posts. They returned to our lines
in the evening.</p>

<p>Life under these conditions was very pleasant and the
Battalion thoroughly enjoyed its stay in this part of the line.
The only interruption beyond the casual shelling of our trenches
and camps was the occasional visit of a flight of enemy aeroplanes
which crossed over and dropped small bombs near our bivouacs.
Usually they passed right over and made targets of the horse
lines and dumps in rear of the Kolonovan Heights, and only
when they were driven off by our anti-aircraft guns did they
attempt to expend their efforts on our small hillside camps.
Aerial activity on this front was very persistent, and practically
every day our bombing planes sailed over and bombed the
railways and dumps behind the Bulgar lines.</p>

<p>Occasionally a fight in the air took place, but the commoner
sight was the repeated attacks of the enemy airmen on our
observation balloon at Kolonova. On one or two occasions it
was brought down in flames, but more often the attacker was
driven off by our anti-aircraft guns, and on one occasion a direct
hit by an “Archie” shell brought down the offending airman.
The plane fell in flames near our battalion transport lines, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
curiously when the wreck reached the ground the machine gun
was still spitting out bullets and a few men of a neighbouring
regiment were wounded by them.</p>

<p>The enemy infantry troubled us very little, and only an
occasional cross fire between patrols made us aware of their
presence, and fortunately they made no endeavours to reach
the Battalion front; although at Bowls Barrow, a few hundred
yards on our right, they made a determined raid on the 1st of
April on a British post and inflicted casualties.</p>

<p>About the middle of April, however, our artillery became
extremely active, and on the 20th the “Nose” and “P” ridge
were heavily bombarded. This was the opening of an offensive
on our part which was undertaken with a view of capturing the
whole of “P” ridge. The bombardment was continued for
three whole days with the intention of cutting the fields of wire
which protected the Bulgar positions and to destroy his forward
entrenchments. On the 23rd of April the volume of artillery
increased considerably and continued until the night of the 24th,
when the 2/20th Battalion of the London Regiment raided the
stronghold of the “Nose.” Under cover of this heavy bombardment
the Blackheath Battalion approached the enemy wire,
and although our artillery had damaged it considerably, it still
formed a great obstacle to the raiders. Heavy machine-gun fire
was encountered, and the front slopes of the “Nose” were
heavily barraged by the enemy, who also used strong search-lights
from the crest of the “Nose” which swept the forward
part of the position. Only a few gallant fellows ever reached
the Bulgar trenches and the casualties were very heavy. For
several nights afterwards search parties were out bringing in
wounded. For the actual raid there was little direct success, but
it served its purpose and acted as feint attack which drew a
great deal of the enemy’s artillery fire, and thereby assisted the
main attack which commenced that same night on the “P”
ridge. This was successful, and Pip 4 and Pip 5 were captured
after heavy fighting. The Battalion actually took no part
in this general offensive, and fortunately the enemy’s artillery
was so deeply engaged in combating the two serious attacks on
their lines at the “Nose” and on “P” ridge that most of us
were able to look from our trenches and watch the pyrotechnic
display on either side. There can be no doubt that the British
suffered heavy casualties in the minor attacks and counter-attacks
which followed this initial success on the “P” ridge, but any
attack on such strongholds as the “Pips” must of necessity
be at great expense. The battle raged for about four days, but
gradually subsided, and on the 27th of April the Battalion was
taken out of the line and marched back to Tetre Verte, just over
the ridge of the Kolonovan Heights, “D” Company remaining
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
at Mektoub in immediate reserve to the London Scottish, who
were holding the line east of Bekerli. Of all the camps in the
Salonican area Mektoub was undoubtedly the safest, as it lay
behind the cover of the hill, and consisted of tiers of dug-outs
built into the very steep side of the hill. While out of the line the
Battalion found fatigues even harder than in the line, for as far
back as Tetre Verte one could wander about unobserved by the
enemy, and, therefore, people who were seen very little in the
front line were now very much in evidence.</p>

<p>On the eighth of May the line from the village of Krastali to
Waggon Hill was slightly advanced in order to straighten the
line which had been pushed forward by the partial success of
the forward movement on the “P” ridge. Of course, this
operation amounted to “peaceful penetration,” and no attack
was necessary. The actual advance was made by the London
Scottish and the Westminsters on that part of the line north-east
of the Bekerli village, and was of course continued towards
Krastali by the division on their right. Only “D” Company
from Mektoub was engaged in this operation, having been
brought up in support of the London Scottish as far as Piton 5,
in rear of Middle Hill, and not to be mistaken for Pip 5 on
the “P” ridge. On the 179th Brigade front the movement was
performed without obstruction by the enemy, though further
north-west near the village of Krastali strong opposition was
met by the Division advancing from the Whaleback, and heavy
artillery support had to be given to assist this section of the
advance. Unfortunately one of the supporting batteries was
firing from the dip in rear of Piton 5 and inflicted several
casualties on “D” Company owing to their shells bursting at
the muzzle of the guns. Lieutenant Miles and Private Cutchee
were badly wounded, while Lieutenant F. W. Lewis and
Lieutenant Martin received minor wounds and remained on
duty.</p>

<p>The original line ran from Bekerli village north-west along
the forward slopes of Mamelon Vert, Bastion Hill, Piton 6,
Hill 275, Scratchbury Hill, Bowls Barrow, along Whaleback to
Horse Shoe Hill, but after the advance the new line ran through
Pitons 1, 2, 3 and 4, Basin Hill, Single Tree Hill, Tomato Hill
over Krastali Nullah forward of Whaleback, and on the Pip
ridge. After the night’s operation on the 8th, “D” Company
returned to Mektoub under the cover of a heavy fog, the rest of
the Battalion having remained at Tetre Verte during the advance.</p>

<p>The next night, the 9th of May, “D” Company left Mektoub
as local reserve for the Westminsters, who pushed forward on to
Goldies Hill, thus forming a salient in our new line between Basin
Hill and Tomato Hill. The taking of Goldies by the Westminsters
was resented by the Bulgar, who made a strong attack
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
on the position with the assistance of a heavy artillery preparation.
However, the Queen’s Westminsters held on and drove
off the attack after heavy local fighting. On the 10th the
Battalion moved from Tetre Verte and took over the new line
from the London Scottish and also Goldies from the Westminsters.</p>

<div id="i275" class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><i>Rough Sketch Map shewing the Advance
in May 1917 on the <span class="smcap">Doiran-Vardar</span> front.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The advance was comparatively a bloodless victory as far
as the 179th Brigade was concerned, nevertheless it was of great
importance on our front. From the new line the Selemli-Dautli
plain was now under our direct observation from Pitons
3 and 4, Basin Hill, Goldies, and these hills therefore became
positions from which an attack on the Selemli Fords could be
attempted. Furthermore, it denied the Bulgar of the freedom
of manœuvre over the captured part of “No Man’s Land,” while
facing north from Goldies and Tomato Hill we were in closer
touch with the enemy’s advanced posts near Devedzili on the
slopes of White Scar and Flat Iron Hills. It had been impossible
for the British forces to push forward before as we had only
captured Pips 4 and 5 on the “P” ridge a few days previously.
The capture of these two pips enabled our men to occupy more
advanced positions without being under the direct observation
of the Bulgar. The enemy resented very much the aggression
on our part, and constantly shelled the newly-taken hills.</p>

<p>For the first fortnight of this period in the line the Battalion
was employed in consolidating the new positions, and on the
forward slopes of Tomato Hill, Single Tree Hill and Goldies,
trenches were dug and each night miles of barbed-wire entanglements
were erected. All this work was carried out under
the protection of strong fighting patrols which took up their
positions on the ravine in front of Flat Iron Hill. In daytime
the hills were left in charge of a single sentry group and one
signaller, while the remainder of the garrison retired for the day
into the small nullahs on the rear of each hill ready to counter-attack
should a message be received from the sentry group.
Throughout the day the enemy ranged in the new-cut trenches,
and with the exception of an unfortunate shell which wounded
Lieutenant Hounsell, our forward groups had a charmed life.
Only a minimum force was left behind the hills during the day;
the remainder of the men returned to the old camps on Hill 275
and Piton 6. At night time, however, when large working
parties were engaged in consolidating the positions, the enemy’s
artillery became very active and many casualties resulted.</p>

<p>However, the hill which received the greatest strafe at nights
was Goldies; the occupation of this point annoyed the Bulgar
very much. The hill consisted of three distinct peaks one in
front of the other, and were known as Goldies I, II, and III.
Trenches were sited on II and III, while on Goldies I a strong
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
patrol went out each night. For the first week of our occupation
the hill was constantly shelled, and no less than ten distinct
batteries showered their offerings on our heads. Fire came from
White Scar direction in the north, from Pip 1 and 2 on the right,
and from the Ouvrage de Trapeze on the left. In time we
became acquainted with the direction of each battery and
special sentries were posted who shouted “No. 6,” and then all the
men on Goldies II bobbed down to the shelter in the shallow
trenches, the occupants of Goldies III taking no notice; but
when the sentry shouted, “No. 4 battery” it was the men on
Goldies III who bobbed down while No. II men carried on with
their work as though nothing had happened. Throughout the
night the hill received a constant bombardment, and in one
hour alone 600 shells fell near Goldies II and III.</p>

<p>Like the garrisons of the other hills the night garrison on
Goldies retired for the day to the nullah in rear of the hill, leaving
a small sentry group on Goldies II and III. The only approach
to the top of Goldies from our lines was up a small ravine, and
the Bulgars were apparently aware of its existence, the place was
shelled both day and night, and was christened Pip Squeak
Alley. At night, large working parties were sent up from the
support battalion of the Brigade and dug a communication
trench up the rear of the hill, and also one connecting Goldies II
and III, but considerable casualties were incurred while the
work was in progress.</p>

<p>The patrol on Goldies I pushed out scouts at night to the
ravine in front, and one night a patrol, under Lieutenant Lewis,
met a strong force of 20 Bulgars and a short sharp fight ensued.
Our losses were only slight, chiefly wounds from bombs, but
several Bulgars were killed, Lieutenant Lewis gallantly rushing
the post and shooting two of the enemy with his revolver.
The next night it was decided to raid the post with artillery
support, but the patrol found that the Bulgar had fled. A
special watch on this ravine was therefore kept, and Lieutenant
Andrew and his batman Joines (“D” Company) spent the next
day hidden in the bushes at the foot of Goldies I. A strong post
of Bulgars came up to the ravine at daylight and settled themselves
comfortably in the ravine, unaware of the watching couple.
After a time a Bulgar N.C.O. wandered away from his comrades
and approached the hiding place of Andrew and his batman,
which was only 25 yards from the enemy. Suddenly the Bulgar’s
attention was attracted by a walking stick on the ground which
had been left by Andrew just before dawn when they took cover
in the bushes. The Bulgar picked it up and examined his
souvenir, but before he had taken full details of his find Lieutenant
Andrew and Private Joines rushed at him and captured him.
Whether the other Bulgars near by were struck motionless or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
whether the N.C.O. was particularly unpopular it is not known,
but in broad daylight and in full view of the enemy Andrew and
his batman chased their prisoner towards our lines and soon got
under the cover of the hill. No attempt was made to follow
them, and the Bulgar N.C.O. was soon on his way to Brigade
Headquarters. It was an amusing adventure, but the brilliant
daring of our two representatives cannot be over-estimated.
Surprise had beaten numbers.</p>

<p>The Battalion held these new positions until the end of May
When the whole Brigade was taken out of the line and concentrated
at Dache near Kolonova. Rumours floated around
that Pip 3 on the “P” ridge was to be our objective, but on the
5th of June orders were received to march back as far as Hadji
Junas, about 10 miles behind the line. The march was carried
out on the night of the 5th of June, and rain poured down making
the route over the soft marshy ground near Lake Ardzan slippery
and treacherous. The Battalion remained here for three days
in hot weather and had an enjoyable rest.</p>

<p>On the 8th of June the march was continued south via Janis
and Kukus as far as Sargol. By this time it was apparent that
Salonica was to be our destination, and on the 11th of June
we arrived at Uchanter, not far from Dudular, our first camp in
Salonica, having stayed one day at Nares and another day at
Ambarkoy on the route. This trek from the line was much
pleasanter than the trek to the line in the previous March.
Marching was done at night under the silvery rays of a bright
moon, each night’s journey being about 15 miles. The
weather was now becoming hot and marching at night was far
more enjoyable than toiling along under the hot rays of the midday
sun; after leaving Hadji Junas the roads were good, and I
think the march was enjoyed by most of us; even the company
mules behaved themselves and gave a minimum of trouble.</p>

<p>For the rest of the week the Battalion, in company with the
remainder of the 60th Division, spent its time doing what the
authorities were pleased to call “intensive training,” which meant
field work from morn to night. During the night of the 19th
of June the Battalion packed up its home and marched to the
docks at Salonica. Great secrecy was made of the destination,
and even the Commanding Officer and his staff who went down
to the ship earlier in the evening were not allowed to return to
the camp in case the news leaked out. On the morning of the
20th of June the Battalion boarded the <i>Abbasieh</i>, and learning that
the boat was one of the Khedival Line, Egypt was soon on every
lip. The sea journey was pleasant, and on the 22nd of June, while
at sea, dinners celebrating the anniversary of our departure from
England, twelve months previously, were held in all parts of the
ship.

<p>Alexandria was reached on the midnight of the 22nd June,
1917, and every one was pleased to get rid of the ever-present
encumbrance on board troopships&mdash;the life belt, which brought
back memories of the <i>Transylvania</i>. What a glorious sunrise we

when no leave ashore was granted, and only a few officers on duty
were allowed on the Docks. Lieutenant Lewis and the writer
however, under the pretext of purchasing food for the officers’
messes, spent a pleasant afternoon in the town and honoured
“Groppi’s Tea Shop” with our presence, only to return to the
boat to find a train alongside with half of the battalion already
entrained. Early in the evening the Battalion started on its
journey to Ismailia on the Suez Canal. Every one enjoyed the
scenery of the Nile Delta while daylight lasted, and the beauty
of the Egyptian sunset appealed to all. Descriptions of Egypt
are to be found in many books, and I need hardly spend any
time in this short history to describe it, sufficient to say that the
Battalion thoroughly enjoyed the train journey and the excitement
of being in a strange land made us forget the war.</p>

<p>Just after midnight the train pulled up at Ismailia and the
desert was struck for the first time. The moon was bright,
making night like day, and under the leadership of camp guides
the Battalion marched through the heavy sand for about a mile
or so and were soon allotted their lines in a huge base camp.
Tea, as usual, was soon made and partaken of. Every one
then retired to their tents and soon fell asleep; here was a
land, at last, where blankets were not absolutely essential.
However, dawn is early in these latitudes, and the sun shone
down with considerable fierceness from about 5 a.m. The
oppressive heat of the tents soon woke every one, to say nothing
of the heavy hum of the aeroplanes from the local aerodrome,
which flew so low that they missed the tent tops by a few feet,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
much to the dismay of the occupants. Flying cannot be carried
out with such security in the heat of the day in Egypt, owing
to the numerous air pockets, and during our stay at Ismailia
reveille each morning was heralded by the heavy drone of these
planes.</p>

<p>Ismailia, a small town on the Suez Canal, has a considerable
French population, connected with the canal company.
The town is very clean, even in the native quarters, while palm
groves and tropical gardens furnish a relieving contrast to the
surrounding desert of yellow sand. During the war it became
the Base of the Australian Imperial Forces and also contained
a large British Ordnance Depot. The main railway line from
Port Said to Suez passed through the town, and on the east lay
the large lakes of Timsah which form part of the Suez Canal.
Leave passes into the town were granted, and this freedom was
greatly appreciated by the men; for since the days of Katerina
we had not even been encamped near a village. Officers were
invited as honorary members of the French Club which provided
excellent luncheons and dinners at a reasonable cost. The place
was crowded each evening and jolly times were spent there.
Leave as far as Cairo and Alexandria was granted, and parties
left daily for three days in one of these cities. A certain
amount of training was carried out in the early morning and in
the evening. The men in their pith helmets and “shorts” soon
became acclimatised and accustomed to the terrific heat of the
sun. Bathing parades in the lakes were held daily, and on the
whole our stay at Ismailia was most enjoyable. At the end of
July the Battalion moved by road as far as Kantara.</p>

<p>It was only a few days after our arrival at Ismailia that the
Transport Section, minus horses, limbers, mules, etc., joined us
from Salonica. They had left on board the <i>Cestrian</i>, and while
at sea had been torpedoed and landed on the island of Mudros.</p>

<p>The following eye-witness story by the Transport Officer,
Lieutenant T. W. Pearson, gives a short description of the
sinking of the <i>Cestrian</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Battalion and part of the transport personnel sailed for
Egypt a few days before the main body of the transport. The
remainder of the transport received orders to load and embark on
the <i>Cestrian</i>, on the 23rd of June, 1917. In addition to ourselves,
with our limbers and animals, the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry
and a Divisional S.A.A. column sailed on the boat; in all about
980 men and 960 animals.</p>

<p>“While we were loading, a German plane came over, but it flew
at such a height that no one took much notice of it, but afterwards
we thought it may have had something to do with the loss of the
<i>Cestrian</i>.</p>

<p>“The Staff Veterinary Officers commented very favourably on the
condition of our animals.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span></p>

<p>“We eventually sailed about 9.0 p.m. in the evening, under
glorious conditions; all the men and animals having comfortable
berths. We were escorted by two destroyers, and these sailed on
either side. We were about 12 or 13 hours out of Salonica early
on Sunday morning, the 24th June, having just been dismissed from
boat drill, and all was peaceful and the water as smooth as a billiard
table, when suddenly the boat gave a terrible lurch; the water
around was churned up and shot to a great height on the starboard
side. We had been torpedoed right amidship and the torpedo
had struck the boilers, and soon every one was drenched with the
sooty water which had been forced out of the funnels, and a funny
looking lot we were.</p>

<p>“Part of the torpedo was forced on the upper deck. It was a
terrible shock to all, as there was no warning whatever, but no one
lost his head, every one went quietly to his respective boat station,
without any panic. One of the life-boats allotted to us was broken
up by the explosion, and, as an example of the coolness of our men,
one of the fellows calmly produced a pocket camera and took
snapshots of the damage.</p>

<p>“Nobody was allowed to go down below to the animals, though
we could hear them screaming. If the incident had occurred about
half an hour later we should have been below at stables and probably
there would have been many more casualties. Fortunately, the
casualties were confined to the ship’s crew below. I heard that one
had been killed and several seriously wounded and scalded.</p>

<p>“Within a few seconds, one of the destroyers was alongside and
commenced transferring the men from the wreck aboard her by
means of ropes and rope ladders, and while this was taking place
she was firing at 1,000 yards range at the periscope of the Hun,
and is believed to have made a hit. The second destroyer was
circling around at full speed to keep the submarine from reappearing.
Many of the men jumped overboard on the port side, but all were
saved by the second escort. The wireless was soon busy, and in a
very short time help came from all directions. The <i>Cestrian</i> did
not sink at once, but was towed to within a few miles of land when
she suddenly went down with all animals on board. It is thought
that she would have been towed in safely except for the fact that
so many port-holes had been left open.</p>

<p>“The men were landed at Mudros, which was one of the islands
used as a base depot during the Dardanelles campaign. We were
a queer-looking crowd when we landed; some with nothing on their
feet; others just in shirts and trousers; I don’t think anyone
was fully dressed. The staff on the island were wonderfully kind,
and did all that was possible to make us comfortable. Within
half an hour of landing at Mudros, all were billeted and were
comfortably housed. The A.S.C. officials were very prominent
and had rations out to the men in a very short time. During our
stay here, the Y.M.C.A. deserves great praise, they got all manner
of things for the men free of charge, and organised concerts. They
did so well that I believe many of the men wrote home to their
parents to send a subscription to the Y.M.C.A. We were on the
island for just a week when we were picked up by a boat from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
Salonica proceeding with troops of our own Brigade (London
Scottish) for Egypt. We arrived in Alexandria minus our transport.
I regret to say that the Battalion never had such good animals
again all the time in the Palestine campaign as those which we
had lost on the <i>Cestrian</i>. On arrival in Egypt the Battalion had to
have the ‘cast offs’ from the other Battalions in the Division who
were reducing their strength, and, naturally, they handed to us all
their ‘duds,’ and you never saw such ‘clothes racks’ as they were.
How the transport ever kept up with the Battalion on trek in
Palestine I don’t know. As time went on, however, we were able to
make exchanges with the Remount Department and got rid of some
of our worst.”</p></blockquote>

<p>To return to the doings of the Battalion in Egypt. Their stay
at Kantara, which had by this time developed into an immense
base for the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, was only for a day,
and they were soon on the train bound for the Palestine Front.
This desert railway across the Sinai Peninsula for over a distance
of 150 miles was one of the finest engineering feats of the war.
Early in the war the British garrison had jealously guarded
Egypt by means of outposts along the Suez Canal, and frequent
raids on this defensive line were made by the Turks. It was,
therefore, decided to push the line right out into the desert,
and under the pressure of the Australian Mounted units, the
Desert Mounted Corps and certain Infantry Divisions, the Turk
was forced north, and when the Battalion joined the E.E.F.
the firing line was just south of Gaza and running inland to
Sheik Nuran on the south-east, generally speaking along the
line of the Wadi Ghuzze. The whole of this advance from the
Canal to Gaza had been made over the trackless waste of the
Sinai Peninsula desert. In order to provide rations, stores and
ammunition to the advancing troops a railway was laid by the
Royal Engineers, ably assisted by working parties of the Egyptian
Labour Corps of natives. The railway was kept up to the
advancing troops at each step forward, and in order to provide
water a pipe line ran at the side of the railway. Dumps and
depots were made at intervals. At El Arish numerous sidings
were built and stores and water were accumulated, and the small
oasis of palm groves became a busy advanced base. From this
point the line was pushed forward through Rafa, and when the
Battalion arrived in Egypt the railhead was at Belah a few miles
south of Gaza; where there were large dumps and also two
extensive stationary hospitals. On arrival at Belah the
Battalion detrained and marched through loose sand, ankle
deep, and great was the relief when it pitched its bivouac near
the seashore; the pleasure of sea bathing was shortlived, for in
a few days, on the 29th July, 1917, the Battalion marched inland
to join the Desert Corps. It was here at Belah that a new
method of transport was introduced in the shape of the Camel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
Transport Corps. That fascinating quadruped, the camel, was
substituted for the mule, although a few mule-drawn vehicles
still remained for general purposes. At Belah there were
extensive camel lines; each camel company, which consisted
of 600 camels, having its own area. Ropes were staked across
the width of these lines at regular intervals and to these ropes the
camels were tethered a few yards apart. Each pair of camels
had an Egyptian attendant, who was dressed in a long butcher-blue
smock with the letters C.T.C. in red on the chest. These
natives took great pride in their lines and kept them particularly
clean, while the saddles were neatly arranged just in rear of
the camels.</p>

<p>The saddle fitted over the hump of the camel, and at each side
near the top of the saddle were fixed two stout bars of wood,
about ten inches longer than the saddles, on to which the loads
were hooked in rope nets. Water was carried in “fanatis” or
copper tanks, which rested on the sides of the saddle. A certain
number of men were detailed as camel guides from each company
and section in the Battalion.</p>

<p>On leaving Belah, on the evening of the 29th July, the Battalion
struck inland in a south-easterly direction along rough-made
tracks, but the sand was loose and made the going very heavy.
Although it was evening time the heat was terrific, and soon the
perspiration was rolling down every one’s face and the dust
raised by the column soon formed into mud on the face and
hands. Every one was choked with dust and eyes and nostrils
became extremely painful. No one felt like singing, and even
talking was rewarded with a mouthful of sand, one and all
just blindly followed on through the cloud of dust raised by
the four in front, which could only just be discerned. Water
was limited, and it was practically forbidden to drink it; only
a mouth wash or gargle could be indulged in. After struggling
for about nine or ten miles in this unpleasant fashion the whole
column was relieved to move off the tracks and settle down for a
rest. With no movement the dust clouds disappeared, and in
the wondrous beauty of the moonlight of a warm Egyptian
night bivouacs were soon erected, but water was too scarce to
make tea, and doubts arose as to when the next issue would
arrive. Nevertheless, tiredness overcame the Battalion, and it
was soon asleep. The next morning the sun poured down, but
the arrival of the water camels cheered us and the routine of
desert life, which was to be our existence for some time to come,
had begun. After a day’s rest, which included the kicking
about of a football by some of the more energetic, the Battalion
moved off again in the evening, about 4 p.m., and plodded its
weary way past Sheik Nuran to Gambli on the Wadi Ghuzze.
This was a repetition of the previous night’s march in every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
detail, except that the ending was not a simple right wheel on to
the level desert, but as a special treat a descent of the steep
cliffs of the wadi banks had to be negotiated. This descent
was difficult with such appendages as company mules, camels
and transport, and was followed by a mile over the stony bed of
the wadi. About midnight the Battalion halted and settled
for the night under the steep banks of the wadi. The next
day the companies went out to take over the line on the Gambli
defences. Reliefs were carried out by day and companies simply
marched over the desert in mass, a most amusing performance
after the communication trenches in France and the careful
night reliefs on the Salonica Front. At this point of the line
the Turks were at least 20 miles away, and, therefore, precautions
from shelling were not necessary. This, indeed, was a pleasant
part to hold and keep. Strong points well wired around were
held, these being about 150 yards apart. The right flank of our
line curled back so that it actually faced away from the Turk.
The front was protected by night by cavalry patrols of
Australian Light Horse, while to the east the Desert Camel Corps
was operating as a mobile flank guard. Bivouacs were arranged
in the small wadis or fissures in the ground and, of course,
movement was not restricted. To those who were not privileged
to see this part of the war it would be humorous to think of
the sentry by day standing in the trench shewing well above the
parapet under the protection of a huge umbrella-like shade
which could be seen for miles around. Although the war in this
theatre lacked shot and shell it had other horrors in the shape
of oppressive heat, limited supplies of water, sandstorms, and
numerous flies. In addition to the ever-present insect life
associated with active service and the trenches, there were
centipedes, scorpions, tarantula spiders and small snakes, which
invaded our blankets. Chameleons were also plentiful and were
kept as pets, though we never committed the atrocity attributed
to a man in a Scottish Division on the Palestine Front who
placed a pet chameleon on his tartan kilt and wondered why the
poor little beggar suddenly died.</p>

<p>An average day in these parts was as follows: Early morning
company drill in front of the wire, breakfast, and then utter
collapse and seeking of shade until about 4 p.m. The only joy
of the hot day was the arrival of the camels with water, and even
this water was strongly chlorinated. Water was drawn from
the Wadi Ghuzze where, by digging down for a few feet, pools
of water were frequently found. During the day every one lay
down and put pieces of muslin over their faces, hands and
exposed knee caps, so that the flies should not be too irritating.
Each afternoon a hot wind, called the “Khamsin,” blew regularly
and brought with it a sandstorm. Drifting sand found its way
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
into every nook and cranny; the food was soon covered and
things were generally unpleasant while the storm lasted. It was
during one of these afternoons that a private remarked: “They
call this a land of milk and honey, eh! One tin between 20
men and not a b&mdash;&mdash;bee to be seen.” However, about 4 p.m.
each day the atmosphere cooled a little; letter writing (not to
forget the inevitable censoring), card playing and dinner were
the next items on the programme, only to be marred by the
company drill and exercises that followed.</p>

<p>At night-time sentry groups were posted by each platoon in
its own strong point, and visiting patrols wandered between the
posts throughout the night. It was a short night and no aerial
torpedoes or other types of frightfulness disturbed the tour of
duty. Each evening about 5 p.m. large bodies of Australian
Cavalry went out to the front, sometimes accompanied by
Armoured Cars, and took up an outpost line some five or six
miles ahead of the defensive line. But even with this cavalry
screen it was possible for a strong raiding party of Turks to
attack one of our posts. In fact, only a short time before our
arrival, our predecessors had been surprised one morning by a
heavy bombardment with field guns, which some adventurous
Turks had brought up under cover of darkness.</p>

<p>The Battalion, however, remained in undisputed possession of
this part of the line until the 12th August, when it was relieved
by the 2/13th Londons (Kensingtons) and retired to Tel el Fara,
renowned as being a camping ground of Richard Cœur-de-Lion
and his Crusaders. Tel el Fara was a high cliff jutting out into
the Wadi Ghuzze and could be seen for many miles around and
was used as an observation post. It was the local landmark for
all who were lost on the desert. It is an easy matter to be lost
on the desert, as each square mile is identical with its neighbours,
and only a feature like Tel el Fara helped the wanderer.</p>

<p>The rest of the month was spent in training and lectures, when
the heat permitted, and was only varied by an occasional route
march in the early morning, not a pleasant outing. The tracks
were not watered by the local borough council and chewing grit
was the only occupation of the silent troops; talking and singing
was impossible, and this denial always added to the monotony of
the march. Practice attacks were also carried out against
imaginary enemies.</p>

<p>By the beginning of September the Battalion had moved to
El Shaulth, near Sheik Nuran, and remained there to prepare for
the offensive which was to be made in Palestine. The men had
become accustomed to the heat and no longer was it necessary
to reserve parades until evening time. All day and every day
training was carried out with vigour, until Brigade operations in
the way of advanced guards, attacks and long night marches
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
became frequent. A rifle range was built and field firing was
done. It may be interesting to mention that some of our
tactical schemes were carried out some six or seven miles in
front of the wire of the defences. On one occasion the
Brigade set out on a long night march by the assistance of many
luminous compasses and numerous pacers, the objective being
a lone tree standing in the open desert some ten miles away from
our camps. The march was made and by all the careful calculations
we arrived at our destination about two hours before
dawn. A halt was called, but no trace of the lone tree could be
found, and after an energetic search by mounted officers and a
consequent “pow-wow” the verdict, “Lost,” was given, and
there was nothing to do but to wait till dawn. When the sun
rose it transpired that we were in the correct spot, but during
the night some Australian Troop, which had run short of wood,
had cut down the tree which had stood alone in the desert on the
previous day, and to all appearances had stood since the days of
the Flood, only to be felled by the hand of a “Dinkum.” The
opinion of the Brigade staff who had arranged this pleasant
little outing is not recorded, but it is thought was not complimentary
to our friends from the Antipodes.</p>

<p>Plans for the great attack were being drawn up about this
time, and officers made reconnaissances towards the Turkish
lines. These outings were no small undertakings. A party of
officers and grooms would leave El Shaulth about 5 a.m. in the
morning and ride over the desert to the more rugged and
undulating country to the south of Beersheba, and then spend
some hours in the heat of the day in scouting over the hills on
foot to become acquainted with the ground, and at the same
time doing their best to evade the Turkish patrols which
frequented the hills. The party would then rendezvous at a
given time in the early evening and start on the homeward
journey. A halt would be called about ten miles from the
Turkish lines, at which point it was considered safe to disregard
the Turk. Here, under the glorious moonlight, a picnic would
be held and the adventures of the day would be recounted, and
after a smoke the journey would be resumed, camp being reached
by about 2 a.m. the next morning. From the Turkish lines to
the Wadi Ghuzze landmarks were definite enough, but on the
other side of the wadi there was nothing but sand for miles.
Everyone knew the most direct route to the camp, and, of
course, this was the beginning of an argument which often ended
in parties of officers going off in different directions. At different
times during the night these parties struck the camp; some
had taken the direct route, some had been misled by lights in
other camps; others found that some camp which had existed
when they went out had moved during the day, and so on.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
However, on return to camp there was always a hot meal ready,
prepared by our faithful batmen, who waited up for us. A
word here perhaps would not be out of place in praise of the
batmen of the Battalion. Veritable “scroungers,” they always
thought of their officers, and nothing was too hot or too heavy,
not even the Company Commander’s valise. At the end of
each day’s trek or manœuvre they forgot their own fatigue and
prepared meals for the mess, the variety of which was confined
to the army rations and the ever-present issue of sand.</p>

<p>The only excitement of the war at El Shaulth was the daily
visit of two enemy aeroplanes to our camps and a few days’
operations at Hiseia, on the Wadi Ghuzze, where we tackled
the banks of the wadi instead of trenches dug in the flat sand,
and where we had already exhausted the possibility of taking
cover on such ground during the attack.</p>

<p>Besides the shortage of water, fuel was also very limited, and
Egypt was practically denuded of trees to provide fuel for the
E.E.F. One Company cook, however, had different views as
to the origin of his firewood, and after vainly endeavouring to
chop a hard piece of olive wood which had been issued to him,
paused, and with much emphasis consigned the trunk to a far
hotter fire than his own, remarking what he required was “wood
and not Adam’s petrified doorposts.”</p>

<p>So far I have only spoken on the warlike side of our stay at
El Shaulth, but among the pleasanter things of life was the
leave to Cairo or Alexandria which had been granted. With
what joy those few miles over the desert to Sheik Nuran were
traversed, followed by a scramble for the leave train and then
a long train journey on the Desert Railway to Kantara, which
took about twelve hours. At Kantara a rush was made for
the Divisional Rest Camp, a wash and shave and breakfast and
a dash for the first available train on the Egyptian State Railways
and then a comfortable journey to Cairo or Alexandria.
I need hardly describe either of these cities, for as holiday resorts
they hold a world-wide reputation. The return to the line
about nine days later was never so pleasant. The heat became
oppressive again, the meal at the rest camp at Kantara was
adversely criticised, and the desert train journey was monotonous
in the extreme. However, on rejoining the Battalion, tales of
the Continental, Shepheards, the Pyramids, the Sphinx, the
Barrage and so forth were told, while the fellows from Alexandria
talked of nothing but the Majestic, the Regina Palace, the Races,
Bathing, and Groppi’s.</p>

<p>By the middle of October the serious side of the campaign in
Palestine had commenced, and most people had had their leave
in Egypt. Leave was stopped and football and sports in the
evenings, and an occasional Divisional concert party were our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
only entertainments. The post was regular and parcels were
received, although occasionally a foot-note in Battalion orders
to the effect that the mails from the United Kingdom on certain
dates had been lost at sea through enemy action made us depressed.
Canteen stores were plentiful, as we were near the
railhead at Sheik Nuran, but they soon became less in quantity
as the ration trains were then being employed for war material
for the coming advance. Towards the end of October the
attack on Beersheba was a popular topic, and the hard training
was not to be in vain. The Battalion was fit and strong,
although malaria and fever had claimed their victims, and a
fair number were sent down to Base Hospitals. However, the
Battalion was ready and willing to show the Turks the way to
the north.</p>

<p>While at El Shaulth several changes took place in the higher
command. Major-General J. S. Shea, C.M.G., had taken over
the Division from Major-General E. S. Bulfin, C.B., who had
been promoted to the command of the 20th Corps, while
Lieut.-Colonel C. de Putron left us to go to the School of Instruction
at Zeitoun, near Cairo, his place being filled by Lieut.-Colonel
T. E. Bisdee (Duke of Cornwall’s L.I.). Colonel Bisdee
was intensely popular with all ranks from the first day of joining
the Battalion, and in the short time he commanded us before
Beersheba he worked wonders. The Company Commanders at
this time were Captains C. H. Rimington, F. W. Lewis, K. A. Wills,
and A. C. H. Benk&eacute;.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII<br />

<span class="medium">BEERSHEBA, 1917 (21ST OF OCTOBER TO 4TH OF NOVEMBER)&mdash;WADI WELFARE</span></h2>

<p>The left flank of the Turkish line, which ran south-eastward
from Gaza, formed a stronghold around the south-eastern
outskirts of Beersheba. In the main scheme of the advance in
Palestine the 60th Division was detailed to attack and take
those trenches covering the Khalasa Road which ran from
Beersheba on the south-west of the town. On the right of the
Division were the 21st Corps cavalry regiment (&frac12;nd County
of London Yeomanry) and they were ordered to make an enveloping
movement simultaneously with the main attack on the Beersheba
defences. From the desert line held by the Battalion near
the Wadi Ghuzze at Gambli a long approach march was necessary.
On the 21st of October, 1917, the Battalion moved from the
Wadi Ghuzze, near Gambli, where the 179th Brigade had been
concentrated. The march was not a difficult one, as the track
lay over country of a more solid surface than the desert we had
just left, but some sympathy must be given to “D” Company
of the Battalion, who had marched some additional eight miles
at midday across the desert from Divisional Head Quarters at
Shellal, where they had represented the Battalion at a Divisional
Church Parade in the morning and had been on parade since the
early hours of dawn.</p>

<p>In the cool of the evening the column started out full of glee,
knowing that at last a march was to be undertaken without that
horrible feeling that the further one went from camp the further
one would have to retrace one’s steps. The weather was fine
and the journey was along the high ground overlooking the Wadi
Shanag, a continuation of the Wadi Ghuzze, past the peak of
Goz Mabrouk and across the Shanag at Bir Esani to the high
ground that lay between the fork of the function of the Wadis
Imalaga and Esani, just south of Rashid Bek. About midnight
the column halted, and the Battalion took up an outpost line
reaching from Rashid Bek, a desolate, empty eastern house
standing some 690 feet above sea-level, to the north bank of the
Wadi Imalaga. The remainder of the Brigade extended the
line to the north as far as the Karm-Beersheba Road. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
line was taken up on the 22nd of October, and the Battalion
remained here until the 28th of October. During the week
forward reconnaissance work was done, and, under cover of the
outpost, stores and guns were brought up by means of tractors,
while large columns of camels and small white donkeys brought
up ammunition, etc. A large dump of foodstuffs and stores
was formed near the Khalasa-Esani road, and it was amusing
to think that this dump was some few hundred yards in advance
of the outpost line, although in front of the dump there was a
cavalry screen of Australian mounted troops. Even if the Turk
had attacked in force the outpost line would have proved a
strong defence, though perhaps the dump and its camel lines
would have been sacrificed. Strict orders were given to the
officers in the line that no one was allowed through the line
without strict scrutiny, as small bodies of nomadic Arabs acting
as spies were always wandering about this neighbourhood. One
evening a horseman approached one of our posts and was promptly
halted. He was challenged. He argued in his Australian
twang that he was friendly, but the officer was adamant and
ordered him to advance for further investigation, to which he
replied, “Do I look like a &mdash;&mdash; spy with these 400 &mdash;&mdash; camels?”
and lo! from the darkness in front loomed a silent column of
camels which had lost their way when returning from the dump
and had not used the recognised gap in the line further to our
right flank.</p>

<p>During this week every one wrote letters as it was a doubtful
thing when the post would next be sent, once the advance had
commenced. Every one rested and no movement by day was
encouraged. Such relaxation came as a welcome change after
the weeks of hard gruelling, and, to quote the words of our
Commander-in-Chief, Field-Marshal Sir Edmund Allenby, on
the occasion of his admission to the Freedom of the City of
London, when he referred to the 60th Division:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Before it attacked Beersheba it was exercising so hard to
keep fit that the G.O.C. ordered his men to eat and drink more
and not work so hard.”</p>

<p>Not only for purposes of rest, however, was this stay made
at Bir Esani. We had left our old line with its water supply
many miles away, and it was necessary for the R.E.’s to develop
and exploit wells that existed at Abu Ghalyun under the cover
of the mounted patrols out to our front.</p>

<p>Our own part of the line was held by “C” and “D”
Companies, with “A” and “B” in support. Fortunately the
Turk did not trouble us, although a short distance further north
a skirmish took place between the 74th Division and the Turk
near the Karm-Beersheba road. The enemy was driven off
with loss and gave no further trouble. On Sunday evening, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
28th of October, the march was resumed as far as Abu Ghalyun,
which lay some seven or eight miles south-west of the Beersheba
defences. The march was only a matter of a few miles and was
along the level though stony bed of the Wadi Imalaga. The
Battalion halted but bivouacs were not erected, and the very
minimum of movement was made. It was a glorious day, and
final preparations for the attack were made; aeroplane maps
were studied and final orders were issued. The Commanding
Officer told the Company Commanders, and through the usual
channels the real facts of the case were put before the private
soldier. Arrangements for transport and water were made,
but the great event was the issue of a small bottle of tea and
rum to each man. Rum was not a regular issue in this hot
climate, but by this time (October) the nights were becoming
colder and the light kit worn by the men required something
more than keenness to get at the Turk to cheer the dawn, hence
the rum and tea. No sign of the enemy was seen this day
except two Turkish aeroplanes flying at a great height over
the concentration of troops from Karm to Abu Ghalyun, but
British air scouts were soon after them and by great skill drove
them down. Later, when the plates in their cameras were
developed at Cairo, a complete set of photographs showing the
concentration of troops was obtained. Had these planes
succeeded in reaching their lines our reception at Beersheba
might have been even warmer.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 30th, before leaving Abu Ghalyun, the
Commanding Officer, Lieut.-Colonel Bisdee addressed the
Battalion and in a few words told us what he expected of us.
The result was never in doubt, and the regiment rose as one
man and cheered him. It is safe to say that at no time previously
was the morale of the Battalion so high, and the morrow
augured badly for “Jacko,” as the Turk was called. It was
our first time “over the top,” as a Battalion, and every man
from the Colonel down to the latest-joined private determined
to prove that the 2nd Battalion of the Civil Service Rifles was
worthy in every way to uphold the traditions of the Regiment,
which had been so gloriously upheld in France by the
1st Battalion. The 60th Division had had a great deal of hard
work and a rough time with no prospect of glory, but that night
it was to start a career of much glory equal to that of any
Division in the War.</p>

<p>The first stage of the march towards Beersheba that night
was as far as Wadi Mirtaba, where the R.E.’s had developed an
efficient water supply a little more than two miles from the
Turkish positions. Here the whole of the wheel transport was
parked under the cover of the steep banks of the wadi, and the
infantry shed their packs and resumed the march in fighting kit.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
From this point we were only accompanied by camels carrying
ammunition and medical and signal stores. A section of the
Machine Gun Corps was attached to the Battalion here, for the
actual attack.</p>

<p>From this point the Khalasa Road ran direct to Beersheba
and formed a splendid guiding line through the wadis and hills
on either side. From aeroplane maps sketches of the wadis
had been reproduced, and each wadi had been allotted a familiar
name; the local Arabic names were far too difficult to memorise.
Such names as Service, Scottish, Kensington, Westminster,
St. Pancras and Blackheath were given; while each Battalion
had named the wadis in their own particular sector by popular
names; some of our nicknames were Strand, Dorking, Watford,
Walden and Ware Wadis.</p>

<p>About 3,000 yards from the Wadi Mirtaba the Khalasa Road
was joined by the Wadi Halgon, and from this point right up
to the Turkish trenches they intertwined so much that one
could hardly tell whether one was walking on the road or in
the wadi; from this fact the quality of the “road” can be best
judged.</p>

<p>At night-time the Turks sent out patrols to the hills in advance
of the trenches, and from these patrols resistance soon came
in the shape of rifle fire, and after sharp skirmishes they were
driven back to their lines. The only casualty on our side was
a camel belonging to “C” Company. Later machine-gun fire
down the road became heavy and the Companies soon got off
the road into their prearranged wadis, where protection was
good. It might be mentioned here that the wadis in this part
were not deep ravines some sixty feet deep, like the Wadis
Ghuzze, Imalaga and Mirtaba, which we had passed, but were
simply small valleys between the hills, where a dried water-course
was termed a “wadi” after the larger variety further
south.</p>

<p>The advanced guard was carried out by “D” Company, with
orders to reach Poplar Wadi, about 500 yards from the enemy
trenches, and to form a defensive line on the ridges on the
further side of the Wadi; this was carried out without loss, and
strong forward positions were taken up in advance of Poplar
Wadi on both sides of the Khalasa Road. Patrols went forward
nearly to the enemy lines and were able to ascertain that there
were no wire entanglements in front of the enemy position.
This information was invaluable to the artillery, as many rounds
of ammunition were saved, instead of bombarding imaginary
wire. From aeroplane map photographs, definite lines of white
spots could be detected in front of the line of trenches, but that
night it was proved that they were merely white stones cunningly
arranged by the Turk. Throughout the night Turkish machine-gun
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
fire was intermittent and spattered the whole front with
bullets. When dawn broke, any advance up the Wadi Halgon
was impossible, as it was raked by the fire of two machine guns.
Runners kept clear of the road and made their way to the forward
companies by rushing over each ridge into the wadi in
front. One runner, however, unaware of the dangers of the
Wadi Halgon, calmly strolled along in the early morning and of
course, drew violent fire both from machine guns and rifles on
to his tracks, and after a certain amount of dancing about he
fell down. Every one thought he had been hit, but Captain
Wills, regardless of his personal safety, dashed from the cover
of the Wadi and ran out to the man. This again was the cause
of a further hail of bullets, and Wills fell down near the man.
Thinking that both of them were dead the Turks ceased fire,
but a moment or two later Captain Wills got up and made a
successful dash for safety in the wadi, and although the Turks
reopened their fire they did not hit Wills, who was no worse for
his adventures. The man, inspired by Wills, got up a few
minutes later, and also made a dash for our wadi, through a hail
of bullets. Now comes the amusing side of the incident. The
breathless runner handed us a note, and when it was opened the
following words were exposed: “What time shall the platoon
drink its rum and tea? &mdash;&mdash;, Lieutenant, Officer Commanding
&mdash;&mdash; Platoon, ‘C’ Company.” Needless to say no reply was
sent to this request.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>ROUGH SKETCH MAP
“BEERSHABA-HUJ” OPERATIONS.
OCTOBER-NOVEMBER
&mdash;(1917)&mdash;</i></p>
</div>

<p>So much for the events of the night and early morning in
the Wadi Halgon.</p>

<p>In the general scheme it was arranged that the 181st Brigade
on the left of the 179th Brigade, should attack and capture the
strongly fortified hill known as “Hill 1,070,” which towered
up in advance of the general line of the Beersheba defences.
Not until this hill was captured was the main attack to be made.</p>

<p>As soon after dawn as light permitted, the operation of wire-cutting
on the enemy’s advanced works on Hill 1,070 was commenced
by the Artillery and was continued, with short checks
owing to dust clouds, until 8.30 a.m., when the 181st Brigade
moved to the attack, which was undertaken by the 2/22nd and
2/24th Battalions, London Regiment, under cover of an intense
barrage and overhead machine-gun fire.</p>

<p>At 8.42 a.m. the positions were entered and captured, the
Artillery lifting on to the reverse slopes.</p>

<p>During this phase the 179th Brigade, led by the 2/14th and
2/15th Battalions were gradually moving forward for the attack
on the main positions in conjunction with the 181st Brigade.
At 10 a.m. the latter had reorganised and were reported ready
for the next phase, which was preceded by wire-cutting on the
part of the Artillery. This having been completed by 11 a.m.,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
orders were received from the 20th Corps for the assault to
take place in conjunction with the 74th Division on the left
at 12.15 p.m. By 12.45 p.m. the whole of the enemy main
positions were in our hands, and our left artillery group were
left free to assist the attack of the 74th Division, who were
slightly checked on our left.</p>

<p>While the operations against Hill 1,070 were proceeding the
Battalion formed up under cover for their attack; and orders
had been previously issued to “D” Company in the advanced
positions that should the Turk leave his trenches on our direct
front, as the result of the attack on Hill 1,070, he was to be
pursued with fire. Odd men had been seen to retire, and the
message came through that the Turks were retiring, and “D”
Company lined their ridge and poured fire into the enemy
trenches. However, the message of the Turks’ retirement
which came from a rear observation post was not quite correct,
and was far too sanguine. The retirement was not so wholesale
as had been anticipated, and the Turk returned strong
retaliatory fire. “D” Company stuck to their positions, and
although suffering heavy casualties, continued to fire at the
Turks in the trenches. While this battle of cross fire was proceeding,
orders for the general advance were given, and, under
the covering fire of the advanced company, the attacking
Companies “B” and “C,” with “A” Company in immediate
support, rushed the enemy’s line. In spite of heavy opposition
no one hesitated, and the attackers assaulted and captured the
trenches, killing the occupants and pursuing with fire those who
had retired. The Turks fired until the very last moment, and
when our fellows were within bayoneting distance held up their
hands and cried “Kamerad” or “Arab.” They were poorly
clad, and apparently the sprinkling of German N.C.O.’s had
kept up their morale until the sight of our bayonets. By
12.45 p.m. the position was in our hands, and a line some 800 yards
beyond the trenches was immediately consolidated. Patrols
pushed forward, but little was seen of the Turk; only small
groups could be seen in the distance running away as fast as
their legs could take them.</p>

<p>In clearing the trenches to our right flank, Private E. J. Cook,
“C” Company, the last unwounded member of his Lewis gun
team, greatly distinguished himself. Crawling out of the trench
he engaged a German-manned machine gun point-blank, and
although the Lewis gun was hit and he was twice severely
wounded, he continued to serve his gun until the enemy gun
was knocked out, whereupon it was promptly captured by a
bombing party.</p>

<p>The cavalry who had worked around the flank from the east
of Beersheba occupied the town that evening, and the Reserve
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
Battalions of the 60th Division were sent forward to cover our
front.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the day’s planned operations was marked
by the concentration of the attacking Brigades in the captured
positions, with outposts pushed out on the high ground overlooking
Beersheba. The 2/13th (Kensingtons) which had been
detailed for this duty in our Brigade succeeded in capturing
two 77mm. guns which had been causing us casualties earlier
in the day.</p>

<p>To return to the actual attack by the Civil Service Rifles,
the whole operation had been a great success, and in spite of
considerable casualties the losses could not be considered too
heavy. “D” Company, the advanced Company, had suffered
most while giving support to the attacking Companies. “C”
Company had the next highest total, as it was their misfortune
to advance over the machine-gun swept valley of the Wadi
Halgon. The casualties in “B” Company were much lighter,
as they were able to use the cover of the small branch nullahs
in their advance. “A” Company had very few casualties,
but this does not reflect that they did not do their share; it
was their fortune. The whole Battalion had at last been able
to display its fighting qualities in a real attack. The Battalion’s
captures included three officers and over 50 men, while more
than sixty dead Turks were buried by us afterwards in their old
trenches.</p>

<p>An amusing incident of the final scene of the attack was when
the stentorian voice of one of the sergeants of “C” Company
was heard during the lull in the rifle fire, shouting, “All officers
and sergeants”&mdash;an order which had palled on our ears at the
close of the numerous practice attacks during our training on
the desert.</p>

<p>The evening was quiet enough and the Battalion was not
worried by Turkish artillery fire, and it was only an hour after
the success of the attack was known, when the Battalion transport
under Lieutenant Pearson and the water camels under Lieutenant
Gearing arrived from their hiding-place in the Wadi Mirtaba,
where we had left them the previous evening. Souvenir-hunting
in the Turkish lines was our evening pastime; but not until
search parties had found and collected all the killed and wounded
and every man was accounted for.</p>

<p>The night was cold, but men availed themselves of the protection
of the trenches, and some of the more fortunate succeeded
in obtaining captured tents and bivouac sheets; but these were
unpleasant dwellings and smelt horribly. With the dead Turks
lying around, the whole place was no health resort. The Turk
was a filthy fellow, as his trenches showed, and the whole area
was infested with flies. The next day the dead Turks were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
collected and buried in their trenches. The British guns had
fired with great accuracy into the trenches, and in one instance
had knocked out a machine gun and its team of eight men.</p>

<p>On the 1st of November the infantry were employed in clearing
the battlefield while the 519 Field Company, R.E., entered
the town of Beersheba soon after dawn for the purpose of water
development.</p>

<p>The captures by the 60th Division included two 77 mm.
guns, many machine guns, 15 officers and 193 other ranks
unwounded, and 5 officers and 85 other ranks wounded.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 3rd of November the Battalion moved
to the valley on the south-eastern outskirts of the town. The
whole valley was crowded with British troops and transport.
Beersheba as a town appeared to be of little value, but its importance
as a stronghold on the flank of the Turkish line was
considerable. Water was obtained from the wells which had
been quickly repaired by the R.E.; the Turk having blown
up the winding gear before he left. In the town, prisoner of
war compounds were established, while a still larger compound
for the natives and Arabs of the surrounding district was made
in the valley outside the town.</p>

<p>The soil of the valley where there is some moisture is exceedingly
rich and is rudely cultivated by the natives, and in
the tracks around Beersheba the Bedouin find ample pasturage
for their flocks and herds which in the evening assemble around
the wells as they did 3,000 years ago. The desert of Beersheba
is very beautiful in spring and early summer when the surface
is carpeted with herbage and flowers; but later in the year it
is parched and desolate in the extreme, not a tree breaking the
monotony of the landscape or the rays of the sun. It was in
the latter state when we arrived.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 3rd of November the Battalion moved
again to Bargut, some two miles or more north of the town
of Beersheba, but were not privileged to pass through the town;
passing it on its western outskirts. At Bargut a bivouac camp
was erected, and the Quartermaster’s Stores and transport
sections moved with us. Officers were allowed the benefit
of their valises which had been reduced to 25 lb. in weight,
and blankets were issued to the men.</p>

<p>Meals were soon prepared, and a day of complete rest away
from the filth of the Turkish trenches was thoroughly enjoyed
by all.</p>

<p>At this time it had become apparent to the Higher Command
that the enemy had been able to anticipate our threat of enveloping
his left flank, by a concentration of his reserves on
the high ground in the neighbourhood of Khuweilfeh. The
Corps Commander therefore decided to throw our whole weight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
upon the centre of the Turkish defences represented by the
Kauwukah system and a series of works extending some 5,000
yards to the east, and at the same time occupying the enemy’s
left flank by the employment of the 53rd Division and mounted
troops at Khuweilfeh.</p>

<p>Accordingly the 60th Division moved over in the direction of
Kauwukah on the 4th of November, the Battalion moving to
Wadi Welfare, a distance of 7 or 8 miles as the crow flies. This
was a most trying march over sandy desert and the sand was
not of that “golden” type which one associates with the east
when reading books, but was of a dirty black variety, and our
memories went back to that first dusty march from Belah to
Abu Sitta some months previously. Every one was covered
with black dust, and eyes and nostrils became unbearable.
Water was limited and the day’s supply had not been received
before starting. The water camels had returned to Beersheba,
but here the supply was insufficient, and they were re-directed
to Abu Irgeig, which was about 7 miles in the direction of Gaza,
and in quite a different direction to that taken by the Brigade.</p>

<p>The ground over which we travelled was extremely hilly,
and the Battalion constantly descended into deep wadis and
ascended over the steep ridges for practically the whole of the
last four miles. It was getting dark, and the difficulties were
tremendous, and credit is due to those responsible that the
various battalions of the Division ever found their allotted areas,
most of which were in the beds of deep wadis. The Battalion
halted about 10.0 p.m., and an outpost line covering the
Divisional front was taken up by the 181st Brigade. No water,
however, was obtainable. All we knew was that the camels
had gone back as far as Beersheba, and knowing the difficulties
of the march that we had encountered, the possibility of the
camels arriving that night appeared remote. However, shortly
after midnight a small voice was heard on the surrounding
heights, “Who is down there?” “2/15th,” we shouted.
“Thank God,” uttered the small voice, “How the devil do
you get down there?” No one could say how we had got
down into this basin-like dip, in the darkness it appeared to be
surrounded by steep cliffs. The small voice was heard no more,
but an hour afterwards the swishing of the water in the “Fanatis”
was heard approaching along a branch wadi, and Lieutenant
Gearing appeared, followed by his convoy of water camels
and their weary leaders. How this officer performed the
journey that night from Bargut to Beersheba and thence to
Abu Irgeig&mdash;where water was drawn&mdash;and eventually across
the wilderness to the Battalion, which was concealed in one of
the many holes in the ground, is beyond imagination. The
water camels, with their officer and his Company guides had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
dragged over a distance of at least 15 miles in the dark. Even
Gearing himself cannot explain; in fact, he never attempted,
and “Sparrow,” as our tiny water officer was called, simply
grinned and felt pleased. There were heroes in the battle of Beersheba,
but no one was so deservedly popular as Gearing that
night. He had done great things through sheer grit, where
thousands would have failed (and not without reason). Great
was the relief on the arrival of the water camels, and then our
minds turned to the transport and Quartermaster’s stores with
its precious rations which had not yet arrived. However, ere
long the voice of Lieutenant Pearson (not a small one this time)
was heard, and we knew that the “gods” were with us. The
route taken by the Battalion had been impossible for wheeled
transport, and it had been diverted some four miles back on
to a different track. Even this second route was extremely
difficult, but the transport section “stuck to their guns,” and
after a somewhat lengthy and tedious journey had struck the
Battalion. It was simply a matter of “striking,” too. Maps
were indistinct, and in the darkness every wadi is a replica of
its neighbour; signposts were badly needed in these parts.
However, daylight came, and this put a better complexion on
the state of affairs.</p>

<p>Officers were called to Headquarters and given details of our
next attack which was to be against the centre of the Turkish
line in Palestine, at a place called Kauwukah. The rest of the
day was spent in reconnaissance of the ground. Landmarks
were few, but all hoped for the best, and compass bearings were
taken. Final preparations were made in the evening and rations
were issued. Water again presented a difficulty, as the wells
at Abu Irgeig had run dry, but it was hoped that the R.E. would
open up a new source during the night.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV<br />

<span class="medium">KAUWUKAH AND RUSHDI SYSTEMS&mdash;ATTACK&mdash;SHERIA&mdash;MUNTARET&mdash;HUJ&mdash;NEJILEH&mdash;AND TO GAZA VIA SHERIA</span></h2>

<p>The position to be attacked was on the high ground at Khirbit
Kauwukah, just north of the Beersheeba-Gaza Railway and
south of Sheria. This was an extensive stretch of trenches
about four miles long, which faced south-west from near Samarra
Bridge to Abu Heirira on the Wadi Sheria. The left of this
trench system was swung round forming a strong defensive
flank facing south-east, and it was against this flank that the
60th Division was to make its attack. In front of our objectives
stretched an open plain for over a mile and, of course, formed
an excellent field of fire for the defenders.</p>

<p>The general plan of attack consisted of an enfilade assault
from the east to be started by the 74th Division on our right
attacking and rolling up the enemy’s works east of the actual
Kauwukah System, followed by our own Division which was
to operate against the main defences with one Brigade of the
10th Division on our left; each Division being echeloned back
from the right.</p>

<p>Careful arrangements were necessary with regard to the
timing of the advance of each Division in order to safeguard
the possibility of the troops of the 60th and 10th Divisions
being enfiladed from the enemy’s works to be attacked by the
74th Division before the latter had accounted for them.</p>

<p>By the flanking attack it was hoped that the 10th Division
on our left would reach the Abu Heirira Redoubt, a strongly-fortified
mound on the edge of the Wadi Sheria. In the 179th
Brigade the Westminsters and Kensingtons were to form the
attacking Battalions and the Civil Service were to be in support;
the Brigade Reserve being the London Scottish. A second
Brigade of the Division, the 180th Brigade with the London
Irish (21/8th) and the St. Pancras (2/19th) Battalions as attacking
Battalions were to push forward on our right. The 181st
Brigade, of Hill 1,070 fame, being the Divisional Reserve.
After the first lines of the enemy’s works had been captured,
it was intended that the 2/15th and the 2/19th Battalions
should continue the advance and take the rest of the Kauwukah
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
System in enfilade as far as the Rushdi System which adjoined
just on the banks of the Wadi Sheria; while the Battalions
of the 10th Division on our left should concentrate their energies
on the strong redoubt at Abu Heirira, and thus complete the
capture of the Turkish positions from the east as far as the
Wadi Sheria.</p>

<p>During the night of the 5/6th of November, 1917, the Battalion
moved from the Wadi Welfare to its position of assembly preparatory
to the opening of the action by the 74th Division
on our right at 5.0 a.m. The position of assembly was some
two miles south-east of the left flank of the Kauwukah System,
and under cover of the undulating ground we waited for the
result of the 74th Divisional attack. One thing which worried
us, however, was the fact that our water supply had not yet
reached us; the camels which had left for Abu Irgeig on the
previous evening had not been heard of since. Just as every
one gave up hope Gearing and his camels appeared over the
crest in front. Here was another adventure of our camel officer.
Finding no water at Abu Irgeig, and learning that some was
obtainable nearer Beersheba, Gearing trudged back, got the
water, and then made a “bee-line” for the Kauwukah System
along the Beersheba-Gaza Railway line. True, the route was
well defined on the map, but when one thinks of the journey
back towards Beersheba from Abu Irgeig wells is a matter of
about eight miles, and after that a night march of ten miles
towards Kauwukah on the return, it was a grand performance
and an exhibition of determination for which Gearing deserved
praise. He had apparently arrived at the position of assembly
just previous to the Battalion, and seeing no Battalion he had
pushed on towards the Turks, and when dawn came, seeing
nothing in front of him, decided to return, and luckily met
us at the appointed place. Water was quickly issued, and
every one was relieved for at least 24 hours.</p>

<p>Being in reserve is always a weary job and always one of
anxiety; if all goes well in front it is easy; but should things
go all wrong it is horrible. During the early morning the 74th
Division had gained their objectives, and by 8.0 a.m. it was
decided to commence operations on our Divisional front. An
artillery bombardment of the Turkish trenches was commenced,
and the Battalions deployed for the attack. However, from
observation it was seen that much of the strong barbed-wire
entanglements in front of the Turkish lines was still uncut, and
it was decided that two batteries of R.F.A. should go forward
and cut the wire at point blank range. By this time the Westminsters
on our direct front had advanced to the ridge overlooking
the plain in front of the enemy’s trenches, and were
suffering many casualties. Suddenly, in rear of our Battalion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
large clouds of dust were seen, and from these clouds came
galloping two batteries of artillery. On they galloped through
the extended lines of the Battalion which lay in support near
the railway bridge at Samarra, and over the ridge in front until
they gained the open plain. Here they unlimbered their guns
and opened a rapid rate of fire on the Turkish lines. The battery
horses at once returned back over the ridge for cover from the
heavy shower of shrapnel which was coming from the enemy
gunners. The teams returned at the gallop, but many horses
were riderless and teams were often dragging one of their number
either dead or wounded. In front of the ridge, in full view of
the enemy, the two batteries continued to pour fire on the
Turkish entanglements. They were paying for their gallantry,
and many wounded artillery officers and men crawled back
over the ridge to receive medical attention at the advanced
dressing station that had been erected at Samarra Bridge, under
cover of the embankment. Only a few men finally remained
with the guns, and under the command of a corporal&mdash;who afterwards
received the D.C.M.&mdash;they continued to successfully
carry out the cutting of the wire. The whole incident was an
inspiration to the infantry, and the gallantry of our brothers
in the gunners encouraged us in our attack, which commenced
to push forward about midday. The Battalion followed
closely on the heels of the Westminsters, with “D” Company
leading. Extended order with lines about 70 yards intervals
in depth was the formation adopted. Once over the ridge the
Battalion came under heavy machine-gun fire and also a shrapnel
barrage. But just ahead we could see the Westminsters pushing
on towards the trench line which was strongly garrisoned, and
with a final rush at 1.0 p.m. they captured their objective.
The Battalions on their flanks had also succeeded, and the
first lines were won. Without a moment’s delay we, together
with the 2/19th on our right, pursued the enemy and captured
many lines of trenches without a great deal of opposition.
Occasionally a machine-gun would hold us up for a few minutes,
but it was soon out-flanked and the line advanced again. All
resistance was broken down and the garrisons killed or put to
flight. Not until the whole of the Kauwukah and Rushdi
systems were in British hands did the Battalion halt, and then
finally took up a position overlooking the Wadi Sheria about
2.0 p.m. in the afternoon.</p>

<p>A defensive line in the vacated trenches was made, and in
the distance across the valley of the wadi columns of Turks
with their transport could be seen hurrying to get out of range
of our artillery fire. The whole attack had been successful
and our casualties were comparatively light. Great losses
had been inflicted on the enemy, and many prisoners were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
captured. The comparative lightness of our casualties was
probably largely due to wide extensions and also to the &eacute;lan
displayed by all ranks who, once they got in close touch with
the enemy, pursued him relentlessly, giving him no time to
develop counter-attacks or occupy a fresh line of resistance.</p>

<p>The flanking attack of the 60th Division had swept forward
over the trenches and the 10th Division on our left altered their
direction slightly and concentrated on the Heirira Redoubt,
which consisted of a large mound literally honeycombed with
trenches and machine-gun emplacements. On the Battalion
front things soon quieted down, but on the right flank of the
Division the Turk had concentrated and was strongly resisting
the British advance towards Sheria Railway Station.</p>

<p>At 3.30 p.m. on the 6th of November orders were received
from the XXth Corps to establish a strong bridgehead across
the Wadi Sheria in order to secure the water supply; the 10th
Division being ordered to relieve the 60th Division in the captured
works.</p>

<p>Accordingly the 180th and 181st Brigades were ordered to
advance and form a bridgehead north of Sheria in order to
attain that object, and were supported by the Divisional artillery,
the 179th Brigade remaining in Divisional Reserve. The
74th Division were ordered to operate on our right, with their
left resting on Khirbit Barrata. At 5.30 p.m. one Company
from the 180th Brigade had captured Sheria Railway Station,
securing some prisoners and two machine-guns, while two
Battalions from each Brigade prepared to cross the Wadi
Sheria and occupy Tel el Sheria, the high ground north of the
town.</p>

<p>Before evacuating Sheria Station, however, the enemy had
succeeded in firing a large ammunition dump south of the
station which commenced to explode just previous to the launching
of the attack. The conflagration raged for some hours,
and so illuminated the country in the vicinity that further progress
was rendered temporarily impossible. Nevertheless, the ground
over which the attack was to be made was carefully reconnoitred,
and at 3.30 a.m. on the 7th the attack was launched by the
2/17th and 2/20th Battalions of the 180th Brigade west of the
Railway, and the 181st Brigade was represented by the 2/22nd
and 2/23rd Battalions east of the railway.</p>

<p>The enemy offered a determined resistance, but by 4.30 a.m.
our objectives were gained. During this part of the day’s
operations our captures included 4 field guns, 4 machine-guns
and over 150 prisoners. The Turks were disinclined to accept
their defeat without further efforts, and at 9.25 a.m. developed
a strong counter attack against the line now held by the 180th
Brigade, but this was effectively broken up by concentrated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
machine-gun, Lewis gun and rifle fire, assisted by the supporting
artillery, with great loss to the enemy.</p>

<p>During the foregoing operations the 2/15th Battalion in
common with the remainder of the 179th Brigade had handed
over their captures in the Kauwukah and Rushdi systems to
the 10th Division and were brought back a few miles and remained
for the night of the 6/7th of November in reserve near
Sammara Bridge. Little rest, however, was possible, as the
weather was extremely cold. The next morning was spent in
reorganising after the previous day’s attack, and in the early
afternoon we were ordered to move to the Wadi Sheria.</p>

<p>About 4 p.m. on the 7th the Battalion, with the London
Scottish on its left, moved forward from a ridge on the eastern
side of the valley of the Wadi, “B” Company under Captain
Lewis leading. While moving across the open we were heavily
shelled. After crossing the Wadi, however, the advance was
pressed, and after considerable opposition and stubborn fighting
the enemy was driven back and we established an outpost line
on the high ground west of the Wadi. During this advance
“B” Company, as advance guard, had engaged a considerable
force of Turks, but led by the personal dash of their Company
Commander, they pushed forward and inflicted severe losses
on the enemy. The Battalion soon followed up and passed
over a large Turkish camp where “B” Company had captured
an anti-aircraft gun, and the night was spent in digging in.
Patrols pushed forward, but no sign of the Turk was found.
Taking up this line ended the second phase of our operations
in Palestine. Beersheba and Sheria had fallen under the pressure
of the 60th Division. The following summary from Divisional
Headquarters on the attacks on Kauwukah and Sheria defences
will no doubt be interesting.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The total prisoners at the end of this stage amounted to 31
officers and 521 men. During the whole of the day the Division was
engaged in severe local fighting, while at times the hostile shell fire,
especially in the afternoon, was particularly troublesome, the
Turkish command obviously realising the importance of denying
us access to the water supply in the Wadi Sheria. It afterwards
transpired from prisoners’ statements that picked troops had been
hastily formed into composite units and entrusted with the defence
of the position. The large number of enemy regiments represented
among the prisoners lent colour to these assertions, the opposing
commanders doubtless fully realising the vital importance of delaying
our advance at this point in order subsequently to secure the
exposed flank of the retreating Gaza garrison.”</p></blockquote>

<p>On the following morning, the 8th of November, the situation
had sufficiently cleared for an advance to be made upon Huj, a
few miles north-east of Gaza, where it was thought there would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
be an efficient water supply. Transport and water camels
had joined the Battalion, and we were complete to move off
about 7 a.m. Cavalry patrols were sent forward to gain
touch with the enemy, who was retiring with all speed. The
ground was undulating grassland with an occasional outcrop
of sandy desert, and movement was fairly easy. The 179th
Brigade formed the advance guard of the Division, having the
2/15th Civil Service and 2/14th London Scottish as its leading
Battalions and covering a wide front. Instructions were issued
to advance towards the high ground near Khirbit Muntaret,
which was known to be occupied by the enemy. For several
hours under glorious weather conditions the Brigade pushed
forward across the undulating country and found no signs of
the enemy except his numerous dumps which he had left hurriedly
behind him. About 10 a.m. cavalry patrols brought in information
to the effect that the enemy was strongly entrenched
on the high ground on the north of the village of Muntaret,
and the Battalion was deployed for attack. There was a considerable
force of Turks near Muntaret and they were well
supported by artillery. The Battalion, having “C” Company
under Captain Wills for their advanced guard, opened out into
irregular artillery formation or, in other words, “blobs” of
Platoons at 150 yards interval. The approach to Muntaret
was over an open stretch of country, and while going over the
ground the Battalion came under very heavy artillery fire, and
suffered considerable casualties. “C” Company soon opened
out into extended order and advanced to the bottom of Muntaret
Hill which was steep and, except for a small ravine
a few feet deep, offered little cover. In spite of the machine-gun
and rifle fire from the trenches, “C” Company crept up the
hill for the final assault, and within a few hundred yards of the
enemy the men took off their packs and prepared for their
final charge. Led by Captain Wills, they captured the position
(thus forestalling the cavalry, whose objective it had been),
while the London Scottish on their left made a flank attack on
the position at the same time. The rest of the Battalion soon
followed on to the ridge, having also dumped their packs at
the foot of the hill. However, the Turkish artillery continued
to heavily bombard the captured position, and it was necessary
to dig in and consolidate. Further advance was impossible
across the plain west of Muntaret, and any attempt to cross the
plain would mean considerable casualties from shell fire. The
G.-O.-C. Division, Major-General Shea, came up and ordered
the Worcester and Warwick Yeomanry to charge the Turkish
batteries which were holding up our advance. None of us had
had the fortune to see the Balaclava Charge in the Crimean
War, but it was our privilege to see a similar type of gallantry,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
and I insert here an account from a newspaper cutting of the
charge.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“On November the 8th the Londoners while occupying a ridge
less than two miles from the enemy lines, came under extremely
heavy gun fire. Meanwhile the Yeomanry had come up. The
Londoners’ commander, who had seen the whole enemy’s position
and their guns, ordered the Yeomanry to charge them. There were
10 troops of Worcester and Warwick Yeomanry, commanded by a
Colonel, Master of Hounds.</p>

<p>“He and his men swept over the ridge in successive lines about
2,000 yards from the enemy, raced down the slope across the flat,
partly obscured by a mound in front. Over this rise the yeomen
spurred their chargers, took the final rise at a terrific pace, the ranks
somewhat thinned by gun, machine-gun and rifle fire, which the
enemy switched off the Londoners soon after trails of dust told
of advancing cavalry.</p>

<p>“The cavalry’s target was not so much the infantry as the guns.
Giving full-throated cheers they went straight for the field and
heavy pieces. There were 12 guns in action against these valiant
boys from the Shires&mdash;nine German-made field guns and three 5&middot;9
howitzers. The field guns banged as fast as the Austrian and
German gun crews could load them, but every enemy artillery man
was sabred by his piece. The Londoners heard the fire of all the
guns stop dead almost at the same moment.”</p></blockquote>

<p>After witnessing this magnificent feat of arms and benefiting
by the resulting “cease fire” from the Turkish guns, a hasty
meal was taken and a short halt was made. Later on in the
afternoon under the protection of the London Scottish as advanced
guard, the Brigade pushed forward in the direction of Huj.
The 2/14th breasted the high ground at Tor Dimrah, near Huj,
about 4.50 p.m. in the evening of the 8th of November, and
were soon followed by the rest of the Brigade. It will thus be
seen that between 3 a.m. on the 6th of November and 4.50 p.m.
on the 8th, the Division marched 23&frac12; miles, in the course of
which advance the Kauwukah and Rushdi systems of defensive
works were captured, the bridgehead at Sheria stormed, a determined
counter attack repulsed, and the Turkish rearguard
driven from Muntaret to beyond Huj, entailing attacks upon
three defensive positions on the way.</p>

<p>The total captures by the Division in the whole operations
amounted to 12 guns, 26 machine-guns, 51 officers and 907
other ranks.</p>

<p>The following newspaper extract, I think, might be included
here without any shadow of a boast, and summarises our doings
from the commencement of the Palestine campaign.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The achievements of the London Territorials, who had the
hardest part to do in the thrust from our right flank, will rank in
the deeds of the war. A distinguished officer of my acquaintance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
who has seen nearly three years of war in France and watched every
movement of the London County Territorials here, told me that he
could not speak of these warriors without a lump rising in his throat.
This is his considered judgment:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘These Cockneys are the best men in the world. Their spirits
are simply wonderful. I don’t think any division ever went into a
big show with higher morale. After three years of war it was
refreshing to hear the men’s earnestly expressed desire to get into
action again. These grand fellows went forward with the full
bloom upon them. There never was any hesitation. Their
discipline was absolutely perfect, and their physique, and courage
alike magnificent. Their valour was beyond words. The Cockney
makes the perfect soldier.’”</p></blockquote>

<p>In eight days the men marched 66 miles and fought a number
of hot actions. The march may not seem long, but Palestine
is not Salisbury Plain.</p>

<p>On reaching Tor Dimrah near Huj on the evening of the 8th
of November, the Battalion was bivouacked on the grassy slopes
and waited for water and rations to be brought up from Sheria.
During the evening a large British bombing squadron of some
30 planes flew over our heads and no doubt dropped their
missiles with great effect on the columns of retreating Turks
fleeing northwards.</p>

<p>Late at night water and rations arrived and these, together
with cigarettes made from dried tea leaves, helped every one
to retire for the night satisfied with the day’s work.</p>

<p>For the next two days we remained here and the Battalion
was reorganised; transport came up from Sheria and fatigue
parties were sent back to Muntaret for the packs which we had
dumped just before the attack; while others had been left as
far back as Sheria by “C” Company who it will be remembered
started off from the Sheria Wadi as an advance guard. Unfortunately
the water supply at Huj was not so promising as
expected and the damage done to the wells by the retreating
Turk did not help matters. Horses and mules were sent out
in all directions without finding a sufficient supply and lack of
water became so acute that the Artillery men near by sacrificed
their own limited supply for their horses. The difficulty of our
own transport is best described by the following letter from
Lieutenant Pearson, our transport officer at the time:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“On one occasion we left the lines at 5.30 a.m. with the animals
to go about 10 miles for water, and had to be back ready to move
off at 2.30 p.m. When we arrived at the given place there were
several thousands of Australian Cavalry horses, artillery horses,
and several infantry units, animals with only one 30-foot long portable
trough. The Australians’ horses had not had any water for
over 36 hours, so you can imagine there was no system or order,
the horses could not be held back. We had to return without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
watering, and arrived back at 2 p.m. In the meantime, the Battalion
had received further orders to the effect that they would not move
until next day. After feeding the animals, and after the men had
had a snack, we were told there was a well near at hand. We
went in search and found it was about 60 feet deep and had to pull
up a bucketful at a time by means of a long rope; anyway, we
arrived back at 1.30 a.m. The men and animals only having had
one meal at midday between 5.30 a.m. and 1.30 a.m. the next day.
We moved off at 8.30 a.m. the same morning.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The foregoing incident actually occurred while we were at
Tor Dimrah on November 9th, 1917.</p>

<p>From the heights at Tor Dimrah the result of our recent
fighting could be well appreciated. A few miles to the south-west
could be seen the town of Gaza, the scene of heavy fighting
some months previously, while to the west stretched the coastal
plain which ran up country as far as Jaffa. Frontal attacks
on Gaza had proved unsuccessful earlier in the year, and therefore
General Allenby decided to attack from a flank. The line
of attack commenced at Beersheba and was made in a north-westerly
direction, rolling up the Turkish line from the east,
and hoping at the same time to reach the north of Gaza in time
to cut off the garrison. While this flank movement was in
progress local frontal raids on Gaza were made under heavy
artillery bombardments from both land and sea. However,
the Turkish leaders were able to thwart the full intention of
the scheme and by their strong resistance, by powerful flank
guards at Kauwukah, Sheria and Muntaret, were enabled to
give time for their troops at Gaza to retire north with minimum
losses. However, as soon as the Gaza front gave way, the
XXIst Corps under our old Divisional Commander, General E. S.
Bulfin, relentlessly pursued the Turks as far as Jaffa.</p>

<p>Except for the 53rd Division, our own Corps, the XXth, was
withdrawn from the pursuit and, in order to assist the advance,
much of our corps transport was lent to the XXIst Corps. The
53rd Division just mentioned had been kept at Khuweilfeh
just north of Beersheba since the beginning of the offensive,
and had fought manfully against repeated attacks and thereby
protected the right flank of our advance across Palestine.</p>

<p>On the 11th of November the Battalion moved a few miles
north-east to the Wadi Jemmemiah where the whole of the
surrounding country was covered with well planned trenches
and all the valleys covered with machine-gun emplacements;
but the numerous ammunition dumps round about signified
how hastily the Turk had withdrawn without making a strong
resistance. Only a day was spent here, and on the 13th we
moved still farther north to Nejilah; a pleasant spot after the
filth and dust which existed around Jemmeniah. The route
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
was lined with large collections of war material which had been
left by the retreating Turk and everywhere was desolate and
uninviting. Not until a mile or so from Nejilah did the scenery
improve and then a stretch of undulating grassland presented
itself; a restful change for our tired eyes after a lengthy stay
on the glaring yellow desert. A few flocks of sheep strayed over
the pastureland and the quaintly dressed shepherds, at last,
presented to us a fair representation of Biblical Palestine as
we had imagined it in our youth. This was the first clean,
healthy spot, free from sand and the filth which the Turks always
left behind them, we had struck since our arrival at Belah.</p>

<p>For three days the Battalion remained here on these grassy
hill-sides overlooking a wide plain of pasture land to the north.
Just near the camping ground a stream of crystal clear water
flowed and bathing parades were again indulged in. To give
the Britisher his due, he does love cleanliness and even through
the recent advance most of the men had used a portion of their
limited ration for purposes of shaving, although a proper wash
was out of the question. No parades were ordered and a
restful time was spent at Nejilah. However, difficulties arose
with regard to supplies; much of our corps transport having
been lent to the other corps pursuing the enemy. Consequently
the Battalion was ordered to return to Sheria.</p>

<p>As I have already said the Turk revelled in filth and pollution,
and no better illustration could be seen than the Sheria area
where he had apparently had a large base camp since the early
days of the war. For miles around Sheria the place literally
stank and flies were present in their millions. The ground was
strewn with dead Turks, camels, horses and mules, and the
presence of these carcasses did not improve the polluted
atmosphere. However, the desert was expansive and camps
were arranged as far from this debris as possible.</p>

<p>While we had been fighting during the past few weeks
miracles had been performed by the A.S.C. and R.E. The
former corps had worked well and supply dumps had been
advanced with rapidity; camel and horse transport working
in conjunction with the railways in the captured area. The
latter corps had repaired the Turkish railways and used the
captured rolling stock to good purpose; other sections of R.E.’s
had exploited the wells and obtained good supplies of water in
the Wadi Sheria.</p>

<p>November the 17th, just after the arrival in the Sheria area,
was known as “Parcel Day”: it was the first post since our
departure from our desert line on the Wadi Ghuzze. Not only
letters arrived but huge bags of parcels; nearly every man
received a parcel. The owners of many, however, were not to be
found; some had given their lives for their country while others
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
had been sent to base hospitals either wounded or sick. But
each platoon or mess made short work of these and divided the
spoil; it was an unwritten law and not stealing. Luxuries were
plentiful and hundreds of tea parties and dinner parties were
held that evening. Every unit, however, has its “grousers,”
not that they mean any harm, but it is their privilege as British
Tommies. They could not legitimately grouse this night with
all the good things around so they turned their morbid thoughts
to treks and predicted a move on the morrow, when every one
would be laden with luxuries. Their prophecies came true and
the following morning camp was struck and the Battalion
marched towards Gaza as far as Muntaret. On the 19th
of November the march was resumed to the outskirts of the
town of Gaza. The day’s march was not a great distance but
the downpour of heavy rain in the evening drenched all. This
was the commencement of the rainy season in Palestine.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV<br />

<span class="medium">THE MARCH FROM GAZA UP COUNTRY&mdash;ENAB&mdash;THE CAPTURE OF JERUSALEM&mdash;TEL-EL-FUL&mdash;BIREH.</span></h2>

<p>At Gaza the Battalion bivouacked just to the north of the town.
“Town” was perhaps a complimentary term for Gaza at that
time, for it was in a deplorable state. The proud town of the
Philistines and the scene of Samson’s deathly triumph had been
most thoroughly treated to every type of missile known to the
British forces, from rifle bullet to the 12-inch naval projectile,
and there was ample evidence of the efficacy of that treatment.
Scarcely a whole wall remained, big gun emplacements built
of concrete and iron rails, though skilfully hidden, had been
utterly destroyed and most of the trenches flattened out. Before
these had stood formidable obstacles in the shape of cactus
hedges, which had proved themselves more efficient than any
barbed wire, but what remained of these was liberally sprinkled
with shrapnel holes. In short, Gaza had been made as unhealthy
as it was possible for us to have made it, and at last the Turk
had been made to quit, though not without a struggle.</p>

<p>Through the centre of the town a clearing had been made and
the broad-gauge railway was being rapidly advanced. The
methods of the R.E. railway construction companies are well
worth a short description. They were the essence of efficiency.
First the R.E. officer with a few satellites carrying the necessary
instruments would prospect and decide the direction of the
line, and he was quickly followed by a large gang of the Egyptian
Labour Corps who, armed with a tool similar to an adze, but
without that instrument’s sharp edge, and a bag similar to a
carpenter’s, would immediately set to work to clear the ground
and make the necessary cutting or embankment. The sight
of some hundreds of these natives swarming over the position
was exactly like an overturned ant-hill. Every one seemed
to run in different directions, and to the uninitiated confusion
appeared to reign supreme, but the work was completed at a
pace which would have made a “ca’canny” trade union
delegate weep with anguish. When the necessary alteration
to the landscape had been effected more labourers would appear,
each carrying a huge railway sleeper which was dumped roughly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
in position, later to be arranged properly and levelled by soldier
platelayers. This work was no sooner completed than lengths
of rail were dumped upon and quickly secured to the sleepers
by means of fish-spikes. The rails were then trimmed, levelled
and bolted together and very shortly afterwards were being
used by the construction train, which with its supply of material,
could thus closely follow the quickly moving construction gangs.
The “permanent” way thus made could not, it is true, attempt
to rival that to which we were accustomed, but an adequate
supply of transport was absolutely necessary for the success of
the E.E.F. at that time, and in those days no branch of the
Services worked more quickly or efficiently than the railway
construction companies to maintain the supply line.</p>

<p>After a short rest at Gaza we commenced our march northwards
on the 19th of November, 1917. Our actual destination
was unknown, but the “lying jade” had been busy and the
magical word “Jerusalem” was ever on her lips. Private
soldiers or humble subalterns do not presume to understand
the ways of an Army Commander. They have, in the famous
game of war, not even the status of a pawn, but nevertheless
are for ever weighing the pros and cons of each and every movement
they are required to make and thus if anyone had, but
two short months ago, been rash enough to suggest that Beersheba
was the opening move of a game that was to end in the
capture of the Holy City, they would have suggested that the
unfortunate one had been disobeying divisional orders and by
not wearing his helmet had caught a touch of the sun. But
the situation had rapidly changed since the dreary days of the
Gambli defences, and Jerusalem was in fact well within our
reach. True it was that our grip had not been closed upon it,
but the days of the Turk in the home of Christianity were for
ever numbered.</p>

<p>Rain had fallen heavily for a short time during our stay at
Gaza and though its advent had been a welcome change we
later had cause to regret the hot sunny days of the Sinai Desert.
The flat coastal plain which runs north from Gaza has been
cultivated land ever since Biblical times, and is the most fertile
spot in the whole of Palestine, and in consequence the most
thickly populated, though the total number in the whole land,
apart from the cities such as Gaza, Jaffa, Ludd and Jerusalem,
would disgrace a small English county. A plentiful crop of
barley which had been grown had been recently cut; indeed
rumour had it that a famous “Scotch” whisky firm had
nearly failed owing to the lack of supplies from Palestine! The
course of our march was set through fields of stubble. When it
was hot and dry, there arose stifling clouds of dust, and when
wet the sticky nature of the ground could even bring a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
“caterpillar tractor” to a standstill. The change, however,
from endless sand was at first welcome and we found great
delight in passing through the native villages. These were
amazing collections of mud huts, windows were unknown and
of sanitary arrangements there were none; yet the inhabitants
though inexpressibly dirty seemed quite happy and contented
with their lot. When opportunity arose we supplemented our
meagre rations by purchasing eggs, figs, nuts and oranges. The
last named were most welcome. We had seen no vegetables
for months and the supply of fruit undoubtedly did much to
dispel the ill effects of this enforced denial of “greens.” The
number to be obtained for one Egyptian piastre (2&frac12;d. English)
varied, but the native drove a hard bargain if you failed to
obtain at least six magnificent Jaffa oranges for that small sum.
Many indeed did show in their dealings with us characteristics
of the descendants of the twelve tribes with which we are all
familiar, but at least one of them met his match. One famous
youth, noticing that a coloured Egyptian bank note had a
remarkable purchasing power, was smitten with a brilliant idea.
Hurriedly quitting the village market place he produced a gaudy
label from a tin of jam and succeeding in persuading a hoary-headed
old extortioner to part with the whole of his stock of
oranges on the understanding that the aforesaid label was worth
untold gold. That youth of course had no right to be a private
soldier “foot-slogging” through the Holy Land; he had
missed his vocation, which was that of a company promoter in
the aeroplane or munition line at home. So many oranges
were eaten on that march that, later on, drafts marching up
from Gaza were known to have followed this trail of orange peel
and found their way across Palestine to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Marching is a thirsty business in any country and when for
the most part the march is made enveloped in clouds of dust,
it becomes even a still thirstier business. We had had long
training in that fine art of marching from dawn to dusk without
having recourse to the water-bottle, and that training stood
us in good stead in those November days. The supply of water
was an ever-present anxiety with the higher command, and in
spite of the exploration of wells by the Royal Engineers, we
were only allowed the meagre amount of one water-bottle full
per man per diem, and this had to be carefully husbanded if
the owner desired to partake of tea ration at the end of the day.
He who could not produce a mugful of water could not draw
a mugful of tea, and this was strictly adhered to.</p>

<p>It was our great good fortune during the whole campaign
never to miss our daily supply of water, and for that great credit
is due to Lieutenant Gearing, who was in charge of the water
camels. He had an uncanny knack of finding his way to us
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
over trackless unknown country, and wherever we bivouacked
for the night he was sure to arrive very shortly afterwards with
his precious convoy of water camels. His trials cannot here be
recorded and their recital on paper would never convey an
adequate impression of his difficulties, and yet no one in the
Battalion ever did better work. Such deeds are not rewarded
with decorations, but perhaps this tardy recognition of his work
will in some way convey to him our appreciation of his excellent
work.</p>

<p>Water was not the only difficulty. Rations were very short.
We had been for weeks on what the A.S.C. called “mobile”
rations, which was the official name for four biscuits, one tin
of bully beef and a small ration of tea and sugar for each man
every twenty-four hours. This was occasionally supplemented
by jam, but even then it was a wearisome diet. “Smokes”
became very scarce and the old substitute of dried tea-leaves
was often in use. Fuel was conspicuous by its absence, as also
were mails.</p>

<p>However we did not grumble too much when we realised the
difficulties of transport. The railway embankment built over
the Wadi Ghuzze had been twice swept away by floods and all
rations, etc., had to be brought by motor lorry from Gaza, and
as there were no roads it was a trying experience for the A.S.C.,
particularly as two of the Motor Transport companies had been
but recently formed and rushed up from the Base and immediately
given the task of supplying a rapidly moving Division over
50-60 miles of trackless country.</p>

<p>In spite of all we pushed on through Beit Hanun, Deir Siniid,
Mejdel, Mesmeyiah, and Junction Station until about the 24th
of November when at Latrun we set foot on the first metalled
road we had seen since leaving Kantara. Latrun is about
midway between Jaffa and Jerusalem and a few miles to the
north-east the road enters the Judean Hills at Bab-el-Wad, and
after negotiating two ranges of hills approximately 2,500 feet
high it reaches Jerusalem which is set at the top of a third and
higher cluster of hills.</p>

<p>The effect of marching on a hard road after months of sand
and soft soil was soon felt and our feet and footwear quickly
began to show signs of wear. Boots, the leather of which had
perished through exposure and lack of grease, were soon worn
through and even the oldest and best of soldiers suffered from
sore feet. The road itself though labelled “metalled” was not
in good condition. The Turk was ever notorious for the bad
state in which he kept his communications and this one was
no exception to the rule. It had not been repaired since the
visit of the Kaiser many years before, and the defects were soon
aggravated by the passage of much transport. It was an

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
exhausting climb and it lasted for a long time. The road was
bounded on the one side for the most part by a precipice and
on the other by the steep hillside, except for a few places where
it ran through deep cuttings, and one could speculate on the
chances of success of any troops attempting to force such a road
against the opposition of a few well-armed British troops and
the result of the speculations was distinctly unfavourable to
the attackers. Yet the Turk had been hurried from hill to hill
with little loss to our troops. As we toiled upwards we
momentarily expected to get our first view of the Holy City.
We knew definitely by that time that such was our objective
and with the words of Holy Writ in our minds&mdash;“a city that is
set on a hill cannot be hid,” we eagerly awaited the vision. That
moment was however denied us for many a day, and it is a
matter of conjuncture whether in any of our minds we felt
satisfied when that view was obtained. It is rather ironical,
but nevertheless a fact, that the first portion of Jerusalem we
saw was of German origin&mdash;the tall tower of the Kaiser’s palace
on the Mount of Olives.</p>

<p>We eventually reached the crest of the first range of hills
at Enab, and descending into the valley on the opposite side we
entered an area which in comparison with the deadly wastes
left miles behind seemed like paradise. The hill sides were
pleasantly wooded, the road was good, fuel and water were in
abundance and a little monastery was discovered to possess a
stock of most excellent wine made from the fruit of the vines
for the cultivation of which the hillsides were terraced. We
remained near Enab for some days and enjoyed life. One
company was unlucky and was sent up to relieve a post of
the 75th Division which had been sorely tried in holding what
they had gallantly won but the remainder of the Battalion
enjoyed a well earned rest. The troops were in great need of it,
but the animals were in a much worse condition. Owing to the
difficulties of maintaining supplies the transport animals had for
nearly a month been on half rations and had done a tremendous
amount of very hard work. They were tired and worn and in
fact were so hungry that the steady diminution of the size of the
tail boards of the limber and the amount of leather harness
eaten by the animals caused the transport officer (Lieutenant
Pearson) many anxious moments.</p>

<p>The remaining brigades of the Division moved up behind us
and the Division took over the right of the line from Soba
through Kushil, Nebi Samwil to Beit Izza. Nebi Samwil, so
called by the reason of its being the traditional burying place
of Samuel, was a distinct thorn in the side of the Turks.</p>

<p>This high hill overlooked Jersualem and threatened the road
to the north from that city and our presence there was much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
resented by the Turks. They made strenuous endeavours to
recapture the hill but all their efforts failed. When the 180th
Brigade took over the hill there was on the top of it a splendid
mosque with a graceful minaret. But Boche gunners with the
Turk were no better in their respect for things religious than
their brethren in France and it was not long before the minaret
and mosque were utterly destroyed by a concentrated bombardment
of heavy metal.</p>

<p>The final preparations for the attack on Jerusalem having
been completed, the 74th Division which had by this time come
up in rear took over Nebi Samwil from the 180th Brigade and
we concentrated near Soba. The 179th Brigade were to attack
the left of the Turkish position near Ain Karim, and if possible
effect a junction with the 53rd Division, which was struggling
up the Hebron road. The 180th Brigade were to attack up
the main Jaffa-Jerusalem road through Kolonieh and Lifta
while the 181st Brigade were in reserve.</p>

<p>On the night 7/8th December we advanced from Soba, crossed
the Wadi Surar and at 3.30 a.m. on the 8th of December the
Brigade attacked the high ground overlooking the Wadi Surar
and south of Ain Karim and were speedily successful. This
operation was a difficult one and its success was essential to
the main operation. The whole brigade with mountain
batteries descended the precipitous hillside in single file. It
was a wretched night with no glimmer of moonlight to assist us
and the rain fell heavily. The whole route was fraught with
much danger to life and limb, but was negociated without a
casualty. The main attack was delivered by the other
regiments in the Brigade but we were called upon to assist.
“C” Company who had taken the Jura Heights and were
subjected to three determined counter attacks, the last two of
which “C” Company helped to break up, were sent to the help
of the Kensingtons.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Captain Leech, our medical officer, hearing that
our sister Battalion had sustained over a hundred casualties,
came up under heavy fire from two machine guns which were
still holding out in a building of Ain Karim in our rear. He
and our stretcher bearers, particularly Privates Davey and
Eels, rendered most gallant service to our own and the Kensington
wounded for which, and for their timely assistance, “C”
Company earned the grateful thanks of that regiment’s C.O.
By 4.0 a.m. all objectives had been gained and one hour later
the main attack up the Lifta road commenced. Much
stubborn resistance was met with, as the Turk was well dug
in and the progress of the attack was retarded by the fact
that our help was not forthcoming as had been expected.
This was not our fault. We had hoped to effect a junction
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
with the 53rd Division, and then advance together, but
the 53rd were by then many miles away fighting hard to come
to our assistance. The resistance they met with delayed
them and we in consequence were subjected to much hostile
artillery fire from our right flank and unable to push forward.
The weather was very bad, a high and bitterly cold wind and
torrential rains made conditions extremely uncomfortable.
We were clad only in tropical kit, had been exposed to the
elements on hills nearly 3,000 feet high for over twenty-four
hours and were by no means in a happy frame of mind. The
Turk was also making himself extremely objectionable and
we were supplied with many gifts in the shape of shells. Our
opinions of Jerusalem at that time are not fit to be recorded
here, and they did not change for many a long day. Near
Lifta the Turk was making strenuous efforts to keep us out,
but by 3.30 p.m. he was dislodged by a gallant bayonet attack,
and Lifta was occupied at dusk. We pushed on to the outskirts
of Jerusalem and remained in battle outposts.</p>

<p>That night pandemonium reigned in the Holy City. The
Turk was evacuating as quickly as possible, so quickly that
when a patrol of the 180th Brigade advanced from Lifta in
the early morning of the 9th of December it was met by the
“Mayor” who proffered the surrender of the city. Major-General
Shea was instructed to accept it and did so at 1.0 p.m.,
and Jerusalem passed for ever out of the dominion of the
Turks.</p>

<p>We were billeted that night in an empty school in a garden
named “Abraham’s Vineyard,” and next day moving out to
the north took up an outpost line at Shafat on the Jerusalem-Nablous
(Shechem) road where we remained till the 15th of
December when we returned to billets in Jerusalem, in the
school in “Abraham’s Vineyard.” Jerusalem was the first
town worthy of the name that we had seen since leaving Ismailia
and to many the prospects held out when viewed from afar off
was not fulfilled on closer inspection. The weather was cold and
wet, but we made light of such minor discomforts, being so
overcome with the novelty of being in Jerusalem. The idea
seemed so fantastic. This ancient city which for centuries
had been a bone of contention between East and West was at
last in Christian hands and withal in the hands of the London
Division! True it is that our Welsh friends of the 53rd
Division had lent a very helping hand by struggling up the
Hebron road, but nevertheless it was to the London Division
that credit was due for the releasing of this home of Christianity
from the hands of its enemies. Yet withal it was difficult to
arouse any real sentiment concerning this famous city. It
was inexpressibly dirty, the people comprised all the nations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
and races known in Biblical times and since, and they like
the city were very dirty. Of sanitation there appeared to be
no sign and outside the Jaffa Gate the main water cistern,
which from its accumulation of rain-water provided drink for
the greater part of the city, had to all appearances not been
cleansed since the time of Herod. The railway station, a
comparatively modern addition, was in a state of chaos,
although perhaps the R.F.C. were to blame for that. The
fine ancient wall which, with the Temple site&mdash;and the water
cisterns&mdash;was one of the only original things left from Biblical
times, had been cut into at the request of the Kaiser and a
hideous clock tower crowned with a large clock by “Dents”
had been built in the gap made. Appallingly dirty fellows in
charge of a few decrepit animals attached to a kind of cab stood
near the clock tower plying for hire, but their condition was
such that it needed no General Routine Order to forbid us to
use them. Of the Holy Places within the city we were allowed
only a view from the outside until some months later, but we
studiously traversed the whole city armed with the Padre as
guide and a Bible as guide-book. We visited the Temple site,
the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, David’s Tower, and traversed
the so-called Via Dolorosa complete with its sites of the supposed
halts of Christ during His journey with the Cross. The pool of
Siloam was an offensively smelling puddle of dirty water, whilst
the Brook Kidron was a mere trickle. Indeed, the whole aspect
of the city dispelled in the minds of most of us that vision we
had often had in our youth and had forgotten of Jerusalem
the Golden. Whatever faith we had in the genuineness of the
Holy Places was sorely tested and it was not long before we
came to the conclusion that one either had to view everything
through rosy-tinted spectacles and believe all that was
said, or be convinced that most of it was sham and accordingly
see the castles built up in our boyhood rudely shattered by a
simple historical fact. Nevertheless Jerusalem possessed a
great attraction for us. Outside the old city had grown up
a comparatively new town with many modern buildings, and
to the north was a genuine church of England&mdash;St. George’s
Cathedral.</p>

<p>The shops began to display their goods openly for the first
time for three years, and the natives offered fruit&mdash;figs, oranges,
nuts, etc.&mdash;for sale in the market places. And indeed it was an
event of some importance to be able to walk the streets of
the famous city Jerusalem and feel that one was really a
Crusader, a descendant of those hardy people who 800 years
ago had borne the heat and the burden of the day clad not in
khaki drill, but in armour. The amount of correspondence which
was handed over to the Army Postal Service was enormous&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
written let it be noted for the main part on German paper
by German pencils&mdash;and in many a home in England to-day is
treasured a Divisional Christmas Card for 1917 sent from
Jerusalem. We had ideas of being able to spend our Christmas
in the city, but that was not to be, and on Christmas Eve, 1917,
we relieved the 180th Brigade in the line Beit Hannina&mdash;Tel-el-Ful
astride the Nablous road. The weather became very bad
and the climatic conditions were by no means pleasant. The
line was held on the west by the Kensingtons in front of Hannain,
and on the east by the Westminsters in front of Tel-el-Ful, and
we were in support. Bivouacs had just been erected and we
were settling down for a wet cold night when the Colonel sent
for Company Commanders.</p>

<p>Headquarters was situated in an old tomb cut in the solid
rock and entering we saw the C.O. seated at the head of a
roughly made table and near him his senior officers. When we
had all arrived he said, “Just listen while I read out the
Brigadier’s Christmas greetings.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“... it is expected that the enemy will attack at dawn on
Christmas morning.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It was an awkward moment, but the Colonel at once relieved
the temporary gloom which had settled on us during the reading
of the message by adding at the end “and England
expects that every one will give the Turk a hearty Christmas
greeting.”</p>

<p>Dispositions were soon made. “A” Company moved out
in support of the Kensingtons at Beit Hannina and “D”
Company to the Westminsters, who were holding the line at
Tel-el-Ful. The Companies were very weak and “D” Company
was reinforced by No. 11 Platoon of “C” Company, the
remainder of the Battalion moving to a hill behind Tel-el-Ful.
It was midnight before the move was complete and nothing
remained but to wait for dawn. It was a most appalling night;
a high wind and torrential rain make life very unpleasant when
one is in bivouacs on top of a hill 3,000 feet high. Our bivouacs
were flooded and we were soaked to the skin, but it was realised
if the Turk attacked under such conditions he would be a
hardier man than we expected. Christmas morning broke and
the grey light from the east disclosed one of the most dismal
pictures dawn could ever disclose. Jerusalem almost hidden
in driving rain on Christmas morning! As we expected, the
attack did not take place, though we could not but realise the
irony of our dear friends at home hurrying off to church to
sing “Christians awake, salute the happy morn,” when the
dear ones for whom they prayed had just spent the most
miserable night of their existence in waiting for a dawn which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
in no circumstances could have been called happy. The rain
continued all Christmas Day until the morning of the 26th when
the sun came out and cheered us. That the attack was imminent
we all knew, but the sun revived our spirits and by midday we
were willing to tackle all the Turks in Asia. We had suffered
several casualties from exposure, but a supply of whale oil for
the feet did much to check wholesale sickness. Information
came through that the attack really would take place on the
27th, and a few minutes after midnight of the 26/27th, the
Turks pushed in an advanced post in front of Tel-el-Ful. The
first main attack came about one hour later, supported by
heavy artillery fire on the Westminsters’ position in front of
Tel-el-Ful. Shortly afterwards the Kensingtons were also
heavily attacked to the west of that hill. The Turk had been
reinforced by new troops from the Caucasus and was making a
desperate effort to retake Jerusalem, so the brunt of this attack
fell on our positions which covered the main road, and only road
from the north. Two platoons of “D” Company were soon
sent up under Lieutenant T. H. E. Clark to reinforce the left
Company of the Westminsters and the struggle was intense.
Eight attacks in all were made on the position in front of Tel-el-Ful,
and in the heaviest just before dawn the Turks succeeded
in effecting a footing in the main positions. The situation was
grave and Colonel Gordon Clarke of the Westminsters thereupon
ordered the officer in charge of “D” Company (Lieutenant
Hutchison) to take the remainder of his Company and eject
the Turk with the bayonet. This counter attack made by
No. 16 Platoon, “D” Company, and No. 11 Platoon, “C,”
under Lieutenant R. H. Harris, M.C. (“Bulldog” Harris of the
1st Battalion), under the command of the O.C. “D” Company,
in spite of severe shell fire, ejected the Turk from the main
position, though not without sustaining severe losses. Lieutenant
Harris, with a party of seven or eight men, became detached and
was surrounded. They fought to the last and Harris, accounting
for at least three of the enemy himself with the bayonet, was
killed. All the remainder of his party were either killed or were
wounded and taken prisoners. These were the only prisoners
we lost in Palestine, but their loss was due solely to the vigour
with which they pushed home their attack. The remainder of
the Company lost heavily and had when they took over the line
from which they had ejected the Turk but 50 per cent.
of their original strength. Junction was made with Lieutenant
Clark and the line was reorganised and held throughout the
remainder of the day in spite of repeated attacks which were
supported by heavy artillery shelling. The following letter
received by our C.O. a few days later gives an appreciation of
the value of the work done:

<p>On the left in front of Beit Hannina, “A” Company did no
less glorious work. After being in the line in the early morning
they were withdrawn until about midday when the Turk made
his final onslaught on our line. He pressed his attack right up
to the stone breastworks which had been erected, and fought
with determination. As on the right in the early morning, the
situation was critical and “A” Company were called up to
assist. In company with the Kensingtons they counter-attacked
with the bayonet, and forced the enemy back. In this action,
Lieutenant R. W. G. Andrews greatly distinguished himself.</p>

<p>A story of the 27th December would be very incomplete
without mention of the gallantry of the other ranks, and particularly
the stretcher bearers. These latter went out time
after time under heavy rifle and machine-gun fire to bring in
wounded comrades. Private Martin, “D” Company, went
out with a fellow stretcher-bearer, Ridley, some forty or fifty
yards from cover, and placed a wounded man on a stretcher.
Whilst doing this Ridley was shot through the head, Martin
thereupon, in spite of the fact that he was much the smaller
of the two men, got his pal on his back, and commenced to
carry him in. He stopped exhausted half-way, and after a
brief rest shouldered his burden again, and got him under cover
only to find that he was dead. Quite undismayed he again
went out with another man, and succeeded in bringing in the
first man safely. All this was done under aimed rifle and machine-gun
fire. Martin afterwards was awarded the Military Medal
although recommended for the V.C. When told of his reward
a few days later all he said was “What about Ridley, sir, I did
no more than he did,” and that epitomises the self-sacrificing
spirit of the stretcher-bearers. (Martin was killed in France some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
months later while gallantly attending the wounded under
heavy fire.)</p>

<p>“A” and “D” Companies were withdrawn from the line on
the evening of the 27th December, and joining up with the
remainder of the Battalion followed up the Turkish retirement
northward next day, which resulted from the crushing blow
by the 10th and 74th Divisions on the Turks’ right flank.</p>

<p>The importance of the operations near Jerusalem at Christmas,
1917, were never properly realised at home. They were
the result of the one really determined counter attack that the
Turk made during the whole of the Palestine campaign. Jerusalem,
and the crumpling of our right flank was his objective,
and to attain it he brought down several new divisions from
the Caucasus, but the result to him was not a victory but a real
defeat, crushing casualties, and an immediate loss of many
more miles of country.</p>

<p>Referring to our subsequent advance, Mr. W. T. Massey, the
official Press correspondent at General Headquarters said in his
dispatch, dated 31st December, 1917:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The rapid advance in most difficult country is due to the overwhelming
defeat of the Turkish attempt to retake Jerusalem on
December 27th, when, after resisting desperate attacks, the British
delivered a masterly counter-stroke, causing the Turks, who had
suffered tremendous losses, to yield almost impregnable positions
and fall back along the Shechem (Nablous) Road, leaving in our
firm possession points of great strategical importance.”</p></blockquote>

<p>General Allenby in his dispatch referring to the same operations
says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The heaviest fighting took place to the east of Jerusalem-Nablous
Road. Repeated attacks were made against Tel-el-Ful,
a conspicuous hill from which Jerusalem and the intervening ground
can be overlooked. The attacks were made by picked troops and
pressed with great determination. At only one point did the enemy
succeed in reaching the main line of defence, but he was driven out
at once by the local reserves”&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>and later referring to the western side of the road where “A”
Company were engaged, he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“At 12.15 p.m. the enemy launched an unexpected attack of
great strength against the whole front, in places he reached our
main line of defence, but these successes were short lived, for, in
each case, local counter-attacks carried out immediately were
successful in restoring the line.”</p></blockquote>

<p>After the defeat of the Turk the Division pursued him, and a
couple of days later were successful in capturing the heights
at Bireh about ten miles north of Jerusalem. While passing
through Ram Allah on the way to Bireh, some of the men we
had lost when fighting at Tel-el-Ful were found wounded, having
been left behind by the Turks.

<p>The capture of the Bireh Heights, and driving the Turk towards
Nablous, completed the capture of Jerusalem, as far as attacks
from the north of the city were concerned, but on the east and
south-east there was still danger. On the 1st January, 1918,
after a night in Jerusalem, the Battalion was ordered to take
up an outpost line to the south-east of the town from Sur Bahir
just off the Bethlehem Road, running in a north-easterly direction
via Khirbit Jubb er Rumm to Abu Dis, just outside Bethany.
The line, therefore, formed a defence about three or four miles
from the city. Sur Bahir was held by “D” Company, Khirbit
Jubb er Rumm by “C” Company, while “A” and “B” were
at Abu Dis. The day was fine when the Battalion marched out
of the town during the morning, but before proper communication
could be established along the line, a heavy rain fell, and
the whole countryside was enveloped in a thick mist. Each
company, therefore, had to form its own strong points, and wait
for dawn on the following day. In the darkness and mist it
was impossible to move over the rough hilly country, and patrol
work was limited to a couple of hundred yards. However,
the next morning in brilliant sunshine patrols were pushed out,
but no sign of the Turk was to be seen. Communication with
the flank companies was obtained, and rations and water supplies
were sent out to each of the companies in the line. Every one
looked forward to a quiet tour of outpost duty. “D” Company,
however, received orders to push out as far as the monastery
at Ibn Obeid on the Wadi en Naar, which in Biblical times was
known as the Brook Kidron, and was three miles south-east
of Sur Bahir. The new line, therefore, ran from north to south,
from Abu Dis to Ibn Obeid, passing through Jubb er Rumm.</p>

<p>The country over which the line ran was composed of stony
hills with deep wadis in the valleys, sometimes 500 feet below
the summit of the surrounding hills. The monastery at Ibn
Obeid which was the southern terminus of the line stood on the
top of the cliffs of the Wadi en Naar which descended steeply
for some 800 feet to the bed of the Wadi.</p>

<p>The monastery had been the scene of some heavy fighting a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
few weeks previous to our arrival, in which a battalion of the
Middlesex Regiment had fought with distinction, and had driven
off repeated attacks of the Turks. When “D” Company,
however, came upon the scene everything was peaceful. Only
a few monks lived in the monastery, and they were soon packed
off to Jerusalem; in case they acted as enemy spies. On the
10th January, the whole Battalion was relieved by the 2/13th
Battalion (Kensingtons) on this outpost line, and moved to
Bethany.</p>

<p>At Bethany three companies were billeted in the local school
and a monastery near by, while “A” Company took up an
outpost position at Sniper’s Post, overlooking the Jericho road,
about a mile or so ahead of the Battalion. Here we reorganised
our specialist sections which had suffered heavy losses in the
fighting around Jerusalem during the latter part of December.
A new draft had just arrived from England, and they were
initiated into the art of warfare in the East by constant training
over the local hills. The remainder of the Battalion was employed
on “road making,” or perhaps I should say making
cart tracks through the wadis near Abu Dis, and occasionally
a strong force of about 200 men would reconnoitre the ground
in front of the Turkish positions along the Jericho road; especially
towards the Arak Ibrahim Caves, some four miles away,
where the Turk had a considerable garrison.</p>

<p>On the 20th “D” Company relieved “A” Company at Sniper’s
Post, but except for the occasional noise of two captured field
guns at Bethany which were used against the Turks at Arak
Ibrahim Caves, there was no sound of war. Six days later the
Battalion moved back to Jerusalem and billeted in some empty
schools in the German part of the city, while many of the officers
were placed in private houses. The journey was full of interest,
and the Mount of Olives, the Garden of Gethsemane, St. Stephen’s
Gate, were passed among other famous sights. On the way we
met a Jewish funeral; we thought that the Macedonian method
of carrying the coffin lid in front of the procession, with the body
exposed to the eyes of the curious, as being a crude method,
but this funeral was even more gruesome. The party rushed
along the road at a great pace, and the corpse wrapped in a
blanket was merely suspended by cord at the head and foot to
a long pole, which was carried on the shoulders of two men,
while the body limply swung from side to side as they hurried
along.</p>

<p>During this stay in the city of Jerusalem, parties under the
expert guidance of our Padre (Rev. G. C. Cavalier) were allowed
to visit the Holy Places in the town. I need hardly recite the
wonders of the Holy City as many guide-books will do so far
better. As far as the Battalion was concerned we enjoyed the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
privilege of seeing these ancient Biblical landmarks. Souvenir
hunting in the shops and the purchasing of food stuffs (chiefly
fruit and bread, which was of a greenish hue when cut, and of
the consistency of gluten) formed the chief amusement during
the day. At night time, however, the two Divisional concert
parties, the “Barnstormers” and “Roosters,” both of which
had made great “hits” in Cairo and Alexandria, were in full
swing at their respective temporary theatres, and provided us
with splendid recreation.</p>

<p>Major Grissel from the 74th Division took over command of
the Battalion on the 28th January, our own Commanding Officer,
Lieutenant-Colonel Bisdee, having been granted leave to the
United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Danger, however, soon occurred from the epidemics of disease
and fever in the city, and the Battalion was moved out of the
town to tents and bivouacs on the slopes of the Mount of Olives;
Headquarters being in a sheik’s house near by. The camping
site was just off the Nablous Road, overlooking the Garden of
Gethsemane, and was on dry, dusty terraces of barren land
which in a few days became a wretched quagmire. Heavy
torrents of rain continually poured down for four days and four
nights without a break, and every one was swamped out and
miserable. Refuge each night was taken in the Divisional
theatres, and large parties would march across the city in the
pouring rain simply for the comfortable shelter of the “theatre.”
When the weather had cleared a little the Battalion was employed
on road-making, and one day an exhibition of “sangar”
building was given by a company of Indian troops who were
past-masters in hill-fighting.</p>

<p>It was, however, unhealthy to live in the mud of the camp,
and the Battalion was moved up to Sir John Grey Hill’s house
at the top of the hill. It was a large desolate mansion, overlooking
the valley of the Jericho Road, while in the far distance
the Moab Mountains could be seen. A short stay of two days
here and the Battalion was moved to bivouacs in the wadis
of the Abu Hindi Wadi on the 13th of February, where preparations
were made for an attack eastwards over the hills
towards the Jericho Plain.</p>

<p>The Turkish line east of Jerusalem consisted of a line of entrenched
strongholds on the hills some eight miles from the
city. The southern extremity of the line rested on Muntar, a
high hill just east of Ibn Obeid Monastery, and came north
via Jebel Ektief, Talat ed Dumm, across the Jericho Road to
the Arak Ibrahim Caves, and thence over Ras el Tawil to the
deep ravine of the Wadi Um Farrar.</p>

<p>The British line ran practically parallel to this line, a few miles
nearer the city, with Ibn Obeid forming the right or south flank,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
and ran north via Jubb er Rumm, Abu Dis, Sniper’s Post, on to
the Jericho Road, and thence north over Suffra to Mukmas.</p>

<p>The intention of the attack was to drive the Turk from the
high ground on the west of the Jordan Plain, and thereby render
the Holy City immune from attack from the east. The advance
was to be made in three distinct phases as follows:</p>

<p>(1) The capture of Muntar, Arak Ibrahim Caves and Ras el
Tawil.</p>

<p>(2) The capture of Jebel Ektief and Talat ed Dumm.</p>

<p>(3) To advance to the steep cliffs overlooking the Jericho or
Jordan Valley.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The three Brigades of the 60th Division were holding the line
in this sector, and the objectives were allotted as follows:</p>

<p>(a) 181st Brigade, Ras el Tawil.</p>

<p>(b) 180th Brigade, Arak Ibrahim Caves and Talat ed Dumm.</p>

<p>(c) 179th Brigade, Muntar and Jebel Ektief.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the 179th Brigade, the 2/14th Battalion (London Scottish)
were given the hill of Muntar as their objective, and they concentrated
in the depths of the Wadi en Naar near Ibn Obeid.
During the night of the 19th of February the companies deployed
and crept up the hill-side under cover of darkness. At
dawn the trenches were heavily bombarded, and the attack was
pushed home under the artillery support. The hill was captured,
and fortunately the strength and resistance of the enemy
had been over-estimated, with the result that the Scottish
casualties were small. The same morning, the 180th Brigade
were successful and captured the caves at Arak Ibrahim in the
centre of the Turkish line with comparatively few casualties.
Further north, however, the 181st Brigade had met with strong
opposition at Ras el Tawil, and after several hours of heavy
fighting gained possession of the hill and put to flight a strong
force of Turks. Casualties, however, on both sides were fairly
heavy.</p>

<p>The first phase of the advance had proved successful, and the
battalions detailed for the second day’s move were able to push
forward and prepare for the assaults on Jebel Ektief and Talat
ed Dumm. Like the first day’s operations the second day’s
attacks resulted in the objectives being taken, although the
fighting was more strenuous as the objectives were surrounded
by more difficult country, which provided the defenders with
better cover. The Turk, finding himself overwhelmed and
outmanœuvred, retired over the hills to the Jordan Valley,
covering his withdrawal with machine-gun rear-guards so that
the third day’s work came under the heading of “peaceful
penetration.” Thus the 60th Division was master of the Jordan
Valley from the commanding heights on the west of the plain,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
and the possibility of an attack on Jerusalem from the east had
disappeared.</p>

<p>To return to the particular part in these operations performed
by the 2/15th Battalion it will be remembered that they were
in bivouacs in the Wadi Hindi on the 13th February.</p>

<p>For the few days previous to the commencement of the advance
we were occupied in road-making in the wadi beds to assist the
bringing forward of guns, ambulances and transport for the
attack. Reconnaissances were also made towards the front, and
on one of these “stunts” our Brigade Major, Captain Sherston,
was seriously wounded in the leg.</p>

<p>On the early morning of the 19th of February we were awakened
by the artillery fire from Abu Dis, where our heavies were
assisting the attack of the London Scottish on Muntar. A few
hours later we learnt of the success, and realised it was now our
turn. During the morning the Battalion gradually moved along
the valley of the Wadi Hindi under cover of the surrounding
heights, “D” Company forming the advance guard. After
advancing some three miles the Battalion was halted as further
advance was impossible by day. Under the cover of an outpost
line the Battalion rested until darkness came, thus making
further progress possible. During the afternoon patrols were
sent out and reconnaissance towards Jebel Ektief was made,
and resulted in a sharp skirmish with the Turkish advanced
posts, but no casualties occurred to our party, although several
Turks were seen to be carried away on stretchers.</p>

<p>About 6 p.m. the order was given to advance to the attack,
and three platoons of “D” Company were ordered to “make
good” the high ground west of the deep ravine in front of Jebel
Ektief while a fourth platoon under Sergeant Cross moved along
the wadi bed to a point where the deep wadi in front of Jebel
Ektief branched off to the left. When these platoons had
pushed ahead sufficiently the remainder of the Battalion marched
along the wadi in order to reach the line of deployment before
daybreak.</p>

<p>Probably of all the country over which the Battalion had
passed throughout its stay in both Salonika and Palestine none
could compare with the deep ravines and precipitous cliffs over
which the advanced guard had to pass, and if this statement is
accepted, there is no need for further comment on the difficulty
of the advance. To move forward a matter of three miles occupied
a full six hours of hard climbing over ridges and difficult
descents down precipices. The night was exceedingly dark,
and great credit is due to Lieutenants Clark and Neall, platoon
commanders in “D” Company, for maintaining their direction
and reaching their objective; the men behaved splendidly and
struggled along through this wretched patch of the Holy Land.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
Fortunately no opposition in strength was met except an occasional
volley of fire from the Turkish advanced posts, but
they soon retired to their main position on Jebel Ektief. Great
caution, however, was necessary as large bodies of the enemy
had been seen that afternoon leaving Jebel Ektief, and advancing
towards our lines. When, however, the advanced guard had
reached the limit of their advance, the Battalion pushed along
the bed of the stony wadi, and were supposed to halt at the
junction of the wadi in front of Jebel Ektief and the main wadi,
where they hoped to turn the corner into their place of deployment.
However, the noise had apparently disturbed the Turk,
and he constantly poured machine-gun fire on to this junction
corner. It was therefore found necessary to find another way
into the Jebel Ektief Wadi, and the only way was to climb the
steep, precipice-like sides of the main wadi on to the high ground
held by “D” Company. This was accomplished, but how, no
one can tell; when the Battalion with its Lewis guns, regimental
aid post, and signalling mules reached the crest, dawn was
appearing in the east. It was decided, therefore, to make a
hurried descent into the Jebel Ektief Wadi in spite of the casual
fire from the enemy’s snipers and machine guns. Luckily the
going down into the second wadi was easier and more speedily
accomplished than the climb from the first wadi, and just as
daylight arrived the tail of the Battalion disappeared into the
bed of Jebel Ektief Wadi, out of sight of the Turks. Once in
the bottom of the wadi the companies sorted themselves out
and prepared for the actual assault, “A” and “B” being the
attacking companies, “C” in support, and “D” in reserve.
It had been arranged that the 2/13th (Kensingtons) were to
assault the position on our left, having approached the wadi at
Jebel Ektief by a night march on a parallel route to the one we
had taken. Unfortunately, the ground over which the Kensingtons
had to pass had proved too difficult, and when daylight
came they found themselves perched on a precipice unable to
cross the deep ravine before them.</p>

<p>At seven o’clock on the morning of the 20th February, the
artillery opened up a heavy bombardment on the hill. The
advance up the hillside described officially as “trickling forward”
should have taken place under this barrage, while the
assault was timed for eight o’clock when the barrage was to
lift.</p>

<p>Unfortunately little or no progress could be made owing to
the fact that the heavies were shelling the “bench mark” some
1,000 yards behind the enemy’s forward lines thereby leaving
the enemy’s machine guns undisturbed, while at the same time
other machine guns on our left raked us, those, in fact, which
should have been concentrating their attention on our brother
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
battalion, the Kensingtons, who had been so unfortunate in their
advance march.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock, when we should have assaulted, the attack
was therefore hung up for a while. An hour later a Forward
Observation Officer having come up, a second barrage was fired
for fifteen minutes concentrating accurately on the forward
Turkish trenches.</p>

<p>At the same time “C” Company was taken from support,
and by means of quick concealed movement succeeded in moving
to our left flank, thereby taking up the position and r&ocirc;le in the
action which should have been the Kensingtons’.</p>

<p>“C” Company was able to make some ground and also was
able to give great assistance to “A” and “B” Companies by
bringing enfilade fire to bear on the snipers and machine guns
that were holding them up.</p>

<p>As this second barrage lifted, the Battalion assaulted the steep
hill and in spite of heavy frontal fire were successful in capturing
the first line. By this time the two companies of the
Queen’s Westminsters had come up on to our left, and under the
gallant leadership of Captain Flower silenced the machine guns
which had enfiladed our attack. When the first ridge was
gained it was found that a valley beyond led to the second ridge,
and here the Turks were again strongly resisting. After a breather,
however, the “Charge” was given, and the men, led by Captain
Wills and Company Sergeant Major Oldcorn of “C” Company,
rushed over the valley and gained the second ridge only to find
a still further ridge strongly held. Machine-gun fire from the
flank was still causing considerable casualties to us, but after
a breather, the Battalion assaulted the third ridge, and thus
completed the capture of Jebel Ektief. The Turks fled down
the precipitous slopes, into the Jordan Valley, and could be seen
collecting in small groups as though preparing for a counter-attack.
The Battalion’s casualties in this action numbered
about one hundred.</p>

<p>Further north of Jebel Ektief, the London Irish of the 180th
Brigade had succeeded in capturing Talat ed Dumm after heavy
fighting. The Turk, however, still had isolated machine guns
on the hills between the recently captured positions of Jebel
Ektief and Talat ed Dumm, and these poured a persistent fire
into our flank. In the late afternoon the Kensingtons came up
on our left, and soon cleared the ground of these irritating
machine guns, and by the evening everything was quiet except
for an occasional shell from a Turkish battery which could be
seen some couple of miles away across the Jordan Plain, well
out of the range of our guns. Just before dark we had a splendid
view of the Jericho Plain.</p>

<p>No other valley in the world presents such extraordinary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
physical features, none other has been the subject of such various
theories as to its origin and character. From our position on
the eastern edge of Jebel Ektief, the ground sloped steeply for
about 2,000 feet to the flat plain below, which stretched for over
twenty miles to the foot-hills of the Moab Mountains. Winding
through the plain the river Jordan could be seen in places
where its steep banks were broken by small branch ravines;
while to the south the dismal flat water of the Dead Sea was
visible. The only town on this extensive plain was Jericho,
and as the light failed it appeared as a dead city of mud huts.</p>

<p>The following morning, the 21st February, the London Scottish
were moved on to the plain as far as the white ruins of
Neba Musa, and Australian cavalry patrolled the Jericho area.
The Turk had crossed the Jordan, and all was quiet. About
midday, however, four enemy planes flew over our positions,
and, but for a remarkable cloud which suddenly enveloped the
hill, would no doubt have poured bullets into our bivouacs.
When the cloud lifted they were nowhere to be seen. For two
days the Battalion remained on the heights of Jebel Ektief, and
although free from fighting it was a most strenuous business
carrying rations and water from the Quartermaster’s Stores
and Transport which were now in the Jebel Ektief Wadi, from
which the attack had started, some 600 or 700 feet below the
summit of the hill.</p>

<p>On the 23rd February, the Battalion was ordered to move as
far back as Jerusalem.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII<br />

<span class="medium">JERUSALEM&mdash;MUKMAS&mdash;JERICHO&mdash;ES SALT&mdash;WADI EL JIB</span></h2>

<p>On the 23rd of February the Battalion left Jebel Ektief, and after
some discussion in the wadi near the transport lines, some
companies chose the route via the Wadi Hindi, Abu Dis and
Bethany, while others struck across country over a distinct track,
supposed to be the remains of a pilgrims’ road to the Jordan, and
thence along the main Jerusalem-Jericho Road, via Bethany.
Which was the better route has not been decided, sufficient to
say that the troops hated both. Rain poured down when we
were half-way to Jerusalem, and when Sir John Grey Hills’ house
was reached late at night no one had the heart to argue as to the
better way from Jebel Ektief. On the following day (Sunday) we
availed ourselves of the rest. In the evening many attended
Divine Service in the huge chapel of the German Emperor’s
Palace, near to the Mount of Olives. It is a huge structure, and a
wonderful view of the surrounding country could be obtained
from the tower. It was used as a Corps Headquarters during the
operations around Jerusalem; not quite the purpose for which
the Kaiser had intended it. The chapel was wonderfully
decorated inside, but the two things which struck one as being
odd, and even profane, were the panelling of the altar, which was
decorated by the crests of each of the Kaiser’s sons; and the
ceiling, which was divided into two parts; one containing a
beautiful painting of the Son of God, while the other contained,
equally well painted, a picture of the Kaiser and his wife sitting
on their thrones!</p>

<p>On the 25th of February the Battalion moved from Jerusalem,
further north to Mukmas; the route was along the Nablous Road
as far as Er Ram, a distance of about five miles, and here we
struck off the main road eastwards over the roughly made
military roads as far as Jeba. Here the route became more
difficult and was across rough mountain paths making it necessary
at times for the Battalion to march in single file. The transport
could not travel the whole route, and was halted near Mukmas,
from which point camels and mules carried stores and rations.
The Battalion halted on the hills near Umm et Talah, and outposts
facing the Jericho plain were taken up by “D” Company.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
The distance as the crow flies from Jebel Ektief to Umm et Talah
was about five miles, but the country was of such a nature that
the only route between these points entailed a long march
through Jerusalem, a distance of nearly twenty miles. Just in
front of the outpost position was Jebel Kuruntul, reputed to be
the Mount of Temptation. For nearly a month of delightful
weather all was peaceful on our immediate front. Occasionally
patrols pushed out to the front and explored the deep ravines
leading on to the Jericho Plain, but only once were we fired on
by the Turks, and then from a considerable range, probably
1,000 yards. Acting on the principle, however, that the Devil
finds work for idle hands to do, that wonderful pastime for tired
troops was revived, namely road-making, and large fatigue
parties were so employed. It had been a source of great interest
to some of us that nowhere behind the Turkish lines, away from
the four main roads which run north to Nablous, south to
Bethlehem, east to Jericho, and west to Jaffa from the city of
Jerusalem, could any trace be found of ways of communication,
except an occasional mule track; whereas, behind our own lines,
a network of specially constructed tracks was always to be found.
It was a mystery to us how the Turks ever moved their guns,
men and supplies in sufficient quantity to even replace normal
daily wastage, but the fact that after the repulse of the counter
attack on Jerusalem in December, 1917, a Turkish Quartermaster
surrendered to one of our posts because he, a Quartermaster,
could not get sufficient food, may indicate that they suffered
from shortages through lack of roads and means of communication.</p>

<p>We had often gazed at dawn on the gorgeous sunrise over the
Mountains of Moab, and seen the dull silver of the Dead Sea
turned to burnished gold; we had also seen that white streak
across the dark plain of Jericho which denoted the presence of
that wonderful stream, the Jordan, but the thought that the
words of the old song “One more ribber to cross” would ever
come literally true never entered our heads. If it did we gave it
no serious thought. We had heard of the Jordan Valley and its
appalling heat in summer (for had not the Turk left in Jericho
a note to the effect that they would return in the autumn to
bury us), and also were familiar with the expression “go to
Jericho,” so, indeed, had no wish to spend any time there. If
the shades of the hereafter are hotter than the scene of Joshua’s
miracle they can have no terrors for the 60th London Division.
“Brass hats,” however, have ever since their creation been seers
of visions and dreamers of dreams, but their decision to give us
an Easter holiday in Moab could only have been the result of
a nightmare.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the 21st March, 1918, saw the 60th Division
concentrated with the Anzac Mounted Division in the Jordan
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
Valley, ready to carry out a raid on a scale unheard of in the
annals of the war: that is, penetrating over thirty miles into
enemy territory of the wildest nature, with the destruction of
the Hedjaz Railway at Annam as the objective. The Civil
Service Rifles crossed the river on the afternoon of the 23rd of
March by a pontoon bridge at Makhadet Hajlah, which had
been gallantly constructed under fire by the Engineers, and
moved up the left bank of the river, passing on our way the
Commander-in-Chief, General Allenby, and the Duke of
Connaught, who was on a tour of inspection well within range of
the Turkish field artillery. Our object to the north was to rout
out a nest of machine guns which was delaying the crossing at
the El Ghoranyieh Ford some five miles to the north, but to our
delight this particular body had realised the threat to their
rear, and had “impshied.”</p>

<p>We bivouacked for the night in the Wadi Nimrin, near Umm
Enkhala, and at 5.0 a.m. the next day moved out in support of
the London Scottish and the Queen’s Westminsters, who attacked
the hill of El Haud which, held in force by the Turk, barred the
second means of approach to Es Salt&mdash;that by way of the Wadi
Arsinyet.</p>

<p>A Boche “pip squeak” battery, which endeavoured to hinder
us, drew the attention upon itself of one of our own 4&middot;5 howitzer
batteries, and speedily ceased fire. We were not called upon to
assist, and were fortunate to witness a most successful attack in
open order against an extended position. The sight of lines of
London infantry advancing calmly under a heavy enemy field
and machine-gun fire, and also of the final assault with the bayonet
was one to be remembered and treasured. El Haud was taken
with little loss to our forces, and we moved up to the foot-hills
and bivouacked in the Wadi Arsinyet, near El Haud.</p>

<p>The river Jordan at Makhadet Hajlah is 1,200 feet below sea
level, and El Haud is 846 feet above, and the weather changed,
becoming steadily worse. The night was wet and bitterly cold,
and we were not sorry to start at 7.0 a.m. the next day on our
advance up the Arsinyet track to Es Salt (Ramoth Gilead).</p>

<p>In heavy rain up a most slippery, muddy, and stony track,
we toiled upwards and upwards as advanced guard to the
Brigade, which, with a Regiment of Australian Light Horse
and Mountain Battery, was soon strung out in single file.
Communication was maintained with the 181st Brigade on the
main Es Salt Road by means of a portable wireless installation,
carried by the Light Horse. After a most exhausting climb of
nearly 3,000 feet, we arrived on the outskirts of Es Salt about
1.0 p.m., thoroughly fatigued and soaked to the skin. The
weather was bitterly cold, and it was felt all the more, for in a
little over twenty-four hours we had moved from the tropical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
heat of the Jordan Valley up some 4,800 feet to the climatic
conditions in winter of the top of a mountain higher than Snowdon.
The Turk had retired hurriedly, and offered little opposition,
and further progress being impossible owing to our exhausted
state we bivouacked&mdash;and slept in inches of mud. The night
was disturbed by much rifle fire from Es Salt, and at dawn on
the 26th, No. 16 Platoon was detailed to reconnoitre the town.
Under Lieutenant Andrew, who was acting as O.C. Company,
they entered the town to find no trace of the Turk, and to receive
a tumultuous welcome from the population who, during the night,
had kept up a “feu de joie” from their house-tops, which noise
we had interpreted as hostile rifle fire. We were the first British
infantry to enter Es Salt, for it was not until some hours later
that the 181st Brigade, which had been moving up the main road
from Shunet Nimrin, arrived in the town. Supplies were lacking
owing to the great difficulty of getting the camels up the slippery
mountain track, and an officer was detailed to proceed to the
181st Brigade and bring back some water camels&mdash;water being
the pressing need.</p>

<p>The remainder of the Division moved up the Annam road, and
the defence of Es Salt was left to the Civil Service Rifles. The
same evening the Battalion moved out to the north-east of the
town to Kefi Huda (3,597 feet), and took up a position covering
the route from the north to Es Salt.</p>

<p>News came through of a possible attack by some 2,000 Circassian
cavalry, and arrangements were at once made for their
proper reception. Time available was short, but by toiling all
night under the protection of standing patrols of the Australian
Light Horse, dawn on the Maundy Thursday saw the 2/15th
snugly settled ready behind stone sangars. Firing started with
the first light of dawn and continued throughout the day, but
no serious attack was attempted by the Turk.</p>

<p>At dawn on Good Friday, under cover of a thick mist, the
Turks attacked with bombs a post in the centre of the Battalion.
An energetic reply with Mills hand and rifle grenades, and a burst
of fire from a machine gun resulted in their speedy repulse. The
mist suddenly lifted, and opposite a neighbouring post was
discovered a Turkish captain and his batman, with their kit
complete. He was brought in and it transpired that he had set
out with 200 men to assault the hill under cover of the mist,
but his left flank got too far forward and pressed the attack
before the remainder were ready, and they in consequence&mdash;like
the burglar who heard the noise overhead&mdash;thought all was
lost and fled, leaving their officer stranded on the hillside. In
his pocket was found a small diagram which showed the relative
positions of all our Lewis and machine guns, and this caused
no little searching in the mind, for we had, as we thought,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
camouflaged them successfully. However, even if he, the
captain, knew, his snipers apparently did not, for, though
throughout the week-end we were continually sniped, one of
our Lewis guns, though continually in action, had not a shot
fired at it.</p>

<div id="i335" class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">SKETCH MAP OF OPERATIONS AROUND JERUSALEM</p>
</div>

<p>There were constant alarms, and on the night of the 30th/31st
March “D” Company repulsed four separate determined attacks
on their position, with no loss to themselves. On the right and
left “A” and “B” Companies were troubled slightly, but
the brunt of the defence of Es Salt fell on the centre of the
line.</p>

<p>The situation was nevertheless serious, and the 2/14th and
2/16th Battalions were brought back to Es Salt.</p>

<p>The Battalion was relieved on the night of the 31st of March, and
at dawn moved down to the south side of Es Salt. The
Divisional withdrawal from Annam, the assault on which place
had not been entirely successful, was now in full swing, and the
majority of the Armenian population of Es Salt, terrified at the
prospect of the return of the terrible Turk, was hastily evacuating
the town. The road, which had been churned up by men,
horses, guns, and wheeled transport, was inches deep in liquid
mud, and was packed with refugees. Old men and boys, women
and children of all ages, with their household goods in large
bundles on their backs, staggered along obsessed with great fear.
Their flight was terrible, and not a few of us hurriedly realised
that it is not only troops who suffer in war time. We could give
little assistance; our own baggage wagons were already overburdened
and our own loads were heavy, but we did what we
could.</p>

<p>At 8.0 a.m. on the 1st of April (Easter Monday), after standing
in full marching order in the mud for a solid hour, we started our
retirement, and though hindered and hampered by the crowd
of refugees which surged and swayed either side of us, we marched
steadily until 5.0 a.m. next day, when we emerged from the hills
at Shunet Nimrin, and bivouacked for a few hours, after which we
continued and, crossing the Jordan River by the Ghoraniyeh
Ford, we arrived at a position in the Wadi Nuemiah about
3 p.m., having covered a distance of about thirty miles since
8.0 p.m. the previous night.</p>

<p>Every one was footsore, dirty, unshaven, with seven days’
growth of beard, and thoroughly tired, but we soon settled down
to our first proper night’s rest for nine days, during which time
we had experienced almost the extremes of heat and cold, and
had marched about seventy miles through some of the most
atrocious country our army has ever operated in. The other
Brigades had fared even worse than we had, but the whole
Division had covered itself with honour, and had no reason to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
dispirited at the apparent failure of its novel enterprise. Gains
in warfare are not measured by territory alone, and the influence
of this raid&mdash;indeed it was almost a campaign&mdash;had a far reaching
effect on the strategy of the Palestine campaign.</p>

<p>We were happy, on our return to the Jordan Valley, to welcome
back from leave in England our Commanding Officer, Lieut.-Colonel
Bisdee, and the Battalion, though it had worked well
under its temporary Commander, was delighted to see its
Commanding Officer back once again, and it speaks much for
the spirit of comradeship of the Regiment that no one was
perhaps more pleased to be with us again than Colonel Bisdee
himself.</p>

<p>After a day’s rest in the valley, we moved once again up
towards Jerusalem, and halted at Talat ed Dumm for twenty-four
hours. At Talat ed Dumm there is a wayside house reputed to
be the Good Samaritan Inn of Biblical times. After this short
rest we again pushed up the old Jericho road, which we had come
to know almost as well as the Strand. On arriving at Jerusalem
we were again billeted on the Mount of Olives. The road from
Jericho goes through particularly desolate and wild country,
and no doubt in years to come, many a Civil Service Rifleman,
when questioned by his offspring concerning the man who fell
among thieves, will truthfully say, “If you had seen the road
you would not be surprised.”</p>

<p>It was not a habit in those days to keep us idle, and we were
soon moved on up the Jerusalem-Nablous road via Bireh and
Ram Allah to the Wadi el Jib, where we temporarily relieved the
10th (Irish) Division. The Battalion was in reserve, and
bivouacked on a terraced hillside which was covered with fig trees
and vines. It was very hot, and we were glad to resume our
summer kit. The camping ground was one of the most pleasant
we had experienced in Palestine, and we made the most of it.
There were flowers and plants in great profusion, and botanists
amongst us spent hours collecting specimens; one of them, a
botanist by profession, collected a hundred or so specimens which
he had never seen before, and which he could not name.</p>

<p>Of actual war we saw but little, occasional bombing raids
were made by enemy planes, but our chief enemy was just behind
us&mdash;a gunner officer in charge of an 18-pounder battery, whose
idea of humour was to give an order for ten rounds gun fire
regularly each night at varying times between midnight and
4.0 a.m. Our considered opinion of this gentleman cannot be
published here.</p>

<p>A week later we moved back as far as Attara, where we gave
a most sincere and regretful God speed to our Colonel, who left
us to take command of the 2/13th Battalion London Regiment.
Colonel Bisdee had joined us at El Shaulth in September, 1917,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
and no Commanding Officer was ever so popular, both with his
officers and men. He had instilled into the Regiment a magnificent
spirit, and it is no idle boast to say that the Regiment would
have gone into action anywhere and under any circumstances
with Colonel Bisdee, with no misgivings and fully aware that,
whatever happened, he would be their leader.

<span class="medium">EL HAUD&mdash;AIN ARIK&mdash;SURAFEND&mdash;KANTARA&mdash;ALEXANDRIA&mdash;JOURNEY TO ITALY</span></h2>

<p>On the 23rd of April, 1918, the Battalion marched south from
Attara and encamped for the night just north of Ram Allah, near
Lake Ballua. The march was carried out during the evening, and
the bright weather made it enjoyable. On the two following
days the journey was continued towards Jerusalem, and on the
night of the 25th we halted at Shafat, a few miles north of the
city. Rumours of another “stunt” across the Jordan were then
confirmed, and on the night of the 27th the Battalion marched
down the Jericho road once more to Talat ed Dumm, arriving
there about 11.0 p.m., where the concentration of transport
foreboded another operation on a large scale. The following
evening the Battalion moved to the Jordan Valley, and crossed
over the river at Ghoraniyeh Ford, which was then held by Indian
troops. Although it was only April the heat in the valley was
terrific during the day, and white troops would, no doubt, have
suffered considerable losses from disease had they been stationed
there for any considerable length of time. The next day was
spent amid the thick brushwood on the plain, and every available
piece of shade was used, but even under this protection the damp
heat was nigh unbearable, and only a minimum of clothing in the
shape of drill shorts were worn by most. There was a large
concentration of troops in the area, and preparations were made
for an attack on the foot-hills of the Moab Mountains.</p>

<p>On the 30th the attack was launched by the 179th Brigade,
the Westminsters on the left and the London Scottish on the
right, while the 180th Brigade was operating farther south.
Under a heavy artillery bombardment the troops advanced
from their positions of deployment, which they had taken up
during the night. They attacked the first ridge and, after heavy
fighting, obtained a footing. Many prisoners were captured
and casualties were inflicted on the enemy. The 2/15th were
held in reserve at Ghoraniyeh Ford, and when a crowd of over
200 prisoners appeared we felt that the operation was so successful
that we should not be needed; it transpired afterwards,
however, that these Turks were not captured in the actual
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
assault, but had been detailed to reconnoitre our concentration
on the plain, and while coming over had walked into the London
Scottish, who were pushing forward for the attack. They made
no resistance, and were soon sent to the rear as prisoners.</p>

<p>After the first ridge had been taken it was found that the whole
position was strongly held by the Turk, and that further advance
over deep ravines swept by machine guns would be very difficult.
Repeated attempts were made to push forward, but only heavy
casualties resulted. The actual objective of the 179th Brigade
was a steep hill called El Haud, which lay some six miles east of
the Jordan, and formed part of a continuous line of steep, rocky
hills that bordered the Jericho Plain on the east.</p>

<p>On the night of the 30th April the London Scottish had only
been able to gain the first ridge of El Haud after heavy fighting,
and during the following day held on to the captured ground with
the idea of pressing forward the attack at dawn next morning.
In order to support this second effort “A” and “B” Companies
of the 2/15th pushed forward to the foot of El Haud, to act as
local supports. The second attack on the 1st of May was also
unsuccessful, not only at this one particular spot but along the
whole Divisional front. Heavy machine-gun fire swept each
ridge, both from the front and the flanks, so cunningly had the
Turk arranged his emplacements. Throughout the day desultory
fighting took place and small local attacks were made, but no
general advance could be accomplished. During the evening
of the 1st of May “C” and “D” Companies were brought up
from the Wadi Nimrin, where they had been moved the previous
night, and during the night of the 1st the Battalion relieved the
London Scottish on El Haud. Orders were received on the same
night to attack at dawn. This meant a busy night in reconnoitring.
“A” and “B” Companies were detailed for the
attack, with “C” Company in support, and just before dawn
they deployed for the attack on the right flank of the hill, from
which point it appeared the approach to the summit was easiest.
“D” Company remained in possession of the captured ridge.</p>

<p>The attack was launched forward with great spirit and dash,
but was met with the same murderous fire that had swept down
the London Scottish in their attempts, and the 2/15th could
only push forward a little way, gaining some 500 yards and a
small hill, thus forming for themselves an unpleasant little
salient into the enemy’s lines. Even then casualties were fairly
heavy, and the work of carrying back the wounded was made
more hazardous by the Turk, who fired on every stretcher with
his machine guns throughout the day. Captain Peatfield, “A”
Company, was reported missing, but late at night he returned
under cover of darkness, having lain out all day in the sun, a few
yards from a Turkish machine gun, apparently dead.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span></p>

<p>At dusk the wounded were collected, and “A” and “B”
were withdrawn, “C” Company staying on the captured ground
and hastily organising it for defence by building sangars.</p>

<p>During the afternoon two platoons of “D” Company, under
Lieutenant K. P. Neall, had attempted to push forward from
the main ridge, but the progress was soon arrested by heavy
machine-gun fire, and this proved conclusively that frontal
attacks were impossible. From the result of this local attack
it was learnt that between ourselves and the Turk was a deep
ravine with precipitous banks. The night of the 3rd of May
was fairly quiet except for the intermittent machine-gun and rifle
fire from both sides. On the following morning, however, the
Turk made a determined counter attack on our immediate right,
against the London Irish of the 180th Brigade. Curiously, just
before this counter attack took place, four enemy planes flew over
our lines and poured machine-gun fire down at us. They did
little actual damage, and one of them was brought down by our
Lewis-gun fire. Every one was on the alert for a repetition of the
aeroplane attack and sought cover behind the numerous boulders
on the hill. However, the planes sailed out of sight behind the
summit of El Haud, and just as every one thought of coming
from their cover a sentry group in front of the Battalion on our
right shouted “they’re coming over,” at which every one near by
took immediate cover, but were soon surprised to find that no
aeroplanes appeared but that a force of Turks about 250 strong
rushed their position and drove them off. The Turkish “coup,”
however, was short lived, and an immediate counter attack by
the “Irish” sent them hurrying back to their lines with loss.
However, the incident was disastrous to that Company of the
2/15th which was holding the little salient which had been
gained during the morning attack of the previous day, as the
Turk was able to pour machine-gun fire into the rear of “C”
Company, causing casualties. The gallant action of Private
Freer, a signaller, in remaining at his telephone though severely
wounded and under close-range rifle fire, materially assisted the
“Irish” to regain their position, for Captain Wills, of “C”
Company, was thus able to send back information which led to
the “Irish” receiving adequate support from our machine guns
and eighteen pounders.</p>

<p>Later in the day the enemy aeroplanes returned, but this time
devoted their attentions to the transport lines and A.S.C. dumps
near Ghoraniyeh Ford. For the rest of the day the infantry
could make no progress, and spent their time watching the
artillery bombardment of those places where machine guns had
been located. The Turk was clever in concealing his emplacements,
and it was only in the evening when a slight breeze
sprang up were we able to detect one that had been firing at us
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
throughout the whole day. This machine gun was in a cave in
the hill side, and the entrance to the cave had been cleverly
camouflaged with a blanket of the same colour as the surrounding
rocks, and not until the breeze caused the blanket to move was it
realised that the fire had been coming from an apparently solid
rock. However, attentions were soon upon this spot, and one of
our machine guns poured heavy fire into the cave, tearing the
blanket in shreds, and no doubt killing the enemy gunners.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 4th May orders were received that the
whole of the British Force would be withdrawn to the Ghoraniyeh
Bridgehead as the Turks had sent a considerable force down the
Jordan Valley from the north, and which had been driven back
by our cavalry that afternoon. However, it was realised that
should this attack by the Turk succeed our left flank and our
line of retreat would both be seriously threatened. In the
Battalion arrangements were made for “D” Company to be
left as a rear-guard, holding the hill of El Haud until the rest of
the Battalion had got a good start across the plain. “D”
Company kept up an occasional Lewis gun and rifle fire for
nearly an hour and then left the hill to the mercy of the Turks.
Every one was relieved to reach the wire entanglements of the
Ghoraniyeh defences the gaps in which were guarded by Indian
cavalry. The amusing part, however, was that when the
Battalion returned to its bivouac area of a few days previous
they found “D” Company there first. Apparently being a
smaller force they were more mobile and certainly they knew
the shortest cut home. Once inside the wire a few hours’ rest
was granted, and at 3 a.m. the withdrawal was resumed as far
as Tel el Sultan, a ruined village near Jericho. We arrived at our
bivouac area early in the morning, and in the glorious warmth of
the day every one enjoyed a thorough rest after the unsatisfactory
hard fighting of the past few days. Before leaving the
subject of El Haud a word of praise is due to the Divisional
R.A.M.C. for the splendid manner in which they evacuated the
wounded during the fighting, and had erected a large field
hospital tent well within range of shell fire under the slopes of
El Haud.</p>

<p>On the 6th of May the Battalion had the surprise of its life,
when orders were received to pack up and move to Jericho, where
motor lorries were to take us as far back as Jerusalem. Never
in its existence had the Battalion partaken of such luxury, but
it is regretted that we all thought that this kindness to tired
troops was to move them to another part of the front where they
were needed in a hurry.</p>

<p>In the late hours of the afternoon the Battalion boarded the
lorries and the convoy started its journey to Jerusalem, along
the new Jericho road, which is a masterpiece in mountain roads,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
and was built under German influence. About half-way home
we met several regiments of Indian cavalry proceeding in the
direction of the Jordan Valley, where they were to hold the line
during the summer months. Many of them wore the Mons Star
ribbon, and apparently had seen fighting in France. After
passing these troops rain commenced to fall and those who had
greedily sought the seats beside the driver paid the penalty and
were soon drenched through. The lorries pulled up just north
of Jersualem on the Nablous road, from which point each load
of men marched independently to the camping ground near
Shafat, which we had occupied only a week previously. The
writer was detailed to supervise the unloading of the Battalion,
and when they had finally “debussed” he made his way to
Shafat probably about 45 minutes after the first party of the
2/15th had left their lorry. In spite of the rain and the muddy
ground bivouacs had been erected and each one had a small
candle burning inside. To see the camp from the roadway
it would have appeared to a casual observer that it had been
in existence for several weeks, so expert had the Battalion become
in erecting its temporary home. Finding his bivouac the
writer was soon presented with a plate of bread, bully beef,
pickles, cheese and a mug of tea by his batman.</p>

<p>On the 7th, the G.O.C. Division inspected the Battalion and
complimented it on the splendid way in which it had stuck to its
unsuccessful work in the recent visit across the Jordan.</p>

<p>The following day the Battalion moved north a few miles as
far as Ram Allah; the march was not long, the road was fair,
and the weather was glorious, and by 2 p.m. the Battalion
had settled down in its new area, and dinners were being cooked.
I have already referred to the speed with which the Battalion
made themselves at home on the night we arrived at Shafat, but
as a further illustration the following true story may be given.
On this day’s march we were followed by the London Scottish,
who were in turn followed by an officer of our own Battalion and
a draft fresh from England who were on their way to join us.
Having missed the Battalion as it left Shafat this new officer
attempted to catch us up. We arrived at our bivouac area
and moved off the road to allow the Scottish to pass to their
camp which was farther north. We immediately put up our
bivouacs and commenced cooking. The new officer and his men
followed the Scottish for some two miles only to find that the
encampment he had passed some 25 minutes before was really
that of his own Battalion. It was hard to make him realise that
we were only just ahead of the Scottish on the march and turning
off the road had immediately set to and erected our camp.</p>

<p>Here news of a long rest reached us, and we were told that
after the next day’s march to Ain Arik we should have a complete
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
rest. On the way to Ain Arik we were inspected by the Commander-in-Chief,
General Allenby, and on the afternoon of the
9th arrived at our new camp. The camp was situated on the
rocky slopes of a deep wadi; little ledges were however found
for “bivvies,” and each company made itself at home in its
particular area. The slopes were covered with many small
trees, and it was undoubtedly one of the prettiest spots in
Palestine that we had visited. Here the Battalion remained for
10 days, and everything was done to make the rest enjoyable.
At the top of the wadi near the main roadway a few level places
were found and football competitions, both inter-Battalion and
inter-company were arranged. A Brigade Sports Committee
was set up and a varied programme of games, sports and transport
competitions was arranged. The final placings were as follows:
2/15th Battalion, 10 points; 2/14th Battalion, 10 points;
2/16th Battalion, 3 points; and 2/13th Battalion, 3 points.
Great credit was due to the excellent turn out of our transport
section, and also our Lewis gunners in their particular competitions.
In the Brigade football final the London Scottish beat
the Queen’s Westminsters after a hard game. The Divisional
Concert Party arrived and gave nightly performances in a large
marquee. In the Battalion itself company concerts were held,
a piano being hired all the way from Jerusalem through the
personal efforts of Lieutenant Phelps. The whist drive held by
“B” Company must also be included in the “mention in
dispatches.” Shooting competitions were held at a small range
built at the bed of the wadi, and Battalion sports, limited to
the three-legged, sack, egg and spoon type of race, were held on
the flat bed of the wadi and proved a huge success. There was
no suitable ground for sprinting, and even the course for the
comic races had to be cleared of large stones by a voluntary
fatigue party. One competition of the afternoon which deserves
special mention was a “beauty competition for the best dressed
lady.” The originality of the aspirants was marvellous, and real
harem dresses with the aid of bacon wrappings, etc., were among
the prize winners. Canteen stores were plentiful and “dinner”
parties were given throughout the camp each night. A real
happy time was spent here and the Battalion was loath to leave
Ain Arik when orders were issued on the night of the 19th May.</p>

<p>The Battalion proceeded next morning to Beit Ello by a
circuitous route around the many hills in that part of Palestine.
A pleasant camping ground was found, and after a night’s rest
we proceeded the next morning to Beit Rima, which was near
the centre of the British line in Palestine which then extended
from Jaffa, on the west, to a point just south of Nablous on the
east. Here the proximity of the enemy’s observation posts
necessitated us to place our bivouacs under the numerous olive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
trees on the terraces round the village. For the next week or
so the Battalion rested by day and each night large working
parties sallied forth north of the village of Beit Rima to dig a
system of trenches for the defence of the hill.</p>

<p>Rumours of France commenced to float about, and these
rumours soon developed into fact. On the 29th of May, 1918,
the Battalion, together with the London Scottish and Queen’s
Westminsters of the same Brigade, bade farewell to the 60th
Division.</p>

<p>In France, heavy fighting and the stupendous thrust by the
Germans in the spring of 1918, necessitated that seasoned troops
from the East should proceed to the Western Front. Certain
Battalions of the 60th Division were therefore withdrawn from
the Palestine Front leaving on an average one white Battalion
in each Brigade, and filling up their vacancies with Indian troops.</p>

<p>Leaving Beit Rima the Battalion trekked to the Jaffa area
via Ibn Harith, Amwas, near Latrun, to Surafend, near Ludd,
which had then become the British railhead for the western
flank of the British line in Palestine. The marches were carried
out by night as the summer heat became too trying for any
movement by day. The nights were warm and glorious, a bright
moon shone throughout the march, the roads were in good
condition, and every one enjoyed the journey. Only one night
was spent at Surafend, and in the afternoon of the 2nd of June
the Battalion marched to Ludd Station and travelled throughout
the night, reaching Kantara by 5 a.m. on the 3rd. A short
march to the rest camp brought the journey to an end, and here
we were met by the advance party under Lieutenant Neall,
who allotted us to our proper lines in the camp.</p>

<p>At Kantara we were fortunate to be given a part of the Divisional
Rest Camp and were not bothered to erect tents as was
the lot of other battalions in the Division. The camp kitchens,
canteens and mess tents were at our disposal, and this saved a
great deal of work and organisation. Immediately on our
arrival large parties were granted leave to Cairo and Alexandria,
and except for morning parades and ordinary camp duties
those who remained took every advantage of the benefits of life
in a base camp. The local cinema huts, concert party marquees
and canteens were packed each night, and every day bathing
parades in the Suez Canal were held. The weather was extremely
hot and the bathing parades were a great boon. Preparations
were also made for an early departure to France.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 15th of June, 1918, the Battalion
paraded and marched to Kantara Station and entrained
for Alexandria, which place was reached by 5 a.m. the following
morning. The train ran alongside our transport, the <i>Indarra</i>.
As soon as the train stopped on the quayside we were busy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
transferring our stores, and for a couple of hours fatigue parties
were constantly up and down the gangways. When this work
was completed the Battalion paraded alongside the boat and
then marched up the gangway, leaving their pith helmets in heaps
on the dock side; it was a pathetic farewell to Egypt, where we
had thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.</p>

<p>The <i>Indarra</i> remained alongside for the day, but no leave
ashore was granted, and the time was spent in allotting boat
stations and issuing life-belts. The following morning we
moved to the middle of the harbour, and during the day bathing
from the side of the boat was permitted, and although a certain
amount of flotsam floated around the ship the warm sea water
was most delightful. Non-swimmers were advised to put on
their life-belts in order to gain confidence in case the journey
was ill-fated, and in many cases the men proved to themselves
the efficiency of the belts in actual water. Practice alarms for
boat stations added to the “pleasure” of the day. About midday
the <i>Indarra</i> was joined by four other transports, namely,
the <i>Kaiser-i-Hind</i>, <i>Malwa</i>, <i>Caledonia</i> and <i>Canberra</i>. This
convoy left the harbour in the evening in single file and was
escorted by armed trawlers and some naval vessels; to one of
which was attached a captive balloon for purposes of detecting
submarines which frequented the area around the entrance to
Alexandria Harbour. Several aeroplanes also flew over the
convoy, and not until we were some 50 miles out to sea did our
aerial escort leave us, when we were handed over to the care of
ten Japanese destroyers and then the trawlers from Alexandria
returned.</p>

<p>By the time the Alexandrian escort had left us the transports
had lined up abreast of each other with a distance of roughly
500 yards between each boat, and this formation was retained
throughout the voyage, the ten Japanese destroyers forming
advanced, rear, and flank guards.</p>

<p>The journey across the Mediterranean was without incident,
and the coast of Italy came into view early on the morning of the
21st of June, and the convoy steamed towards Taranto Harbour.
When the boats arrived within the wide bay just outside the
entrance to the inner harbour every one was relieved, but excitement
was intense when the guns of the escort opened rapid fire
on our left. Immediately the Japanese flag was run up the
mast of each of the destroyers and frantic signals were sent from
the Commander’s boat, which was ahead of the flotilla. Three
of the destroyers rushed at full speed to a spot about two miles
to the left of the convoy and immediately commenced to drop
depth-charges, the explosions of which shook the sides of the
<i>Indarra</i> even at that distance. Torpedoes, however, had
already been fired by the enemy submarine, which had apparently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
been lying in wait in the harbour only a couple of miles from an
Italian Naval Base. One of these torpedoes came at a terrific
speed, leaving a white wake in its trail, and passed in rear of the
<i>Malwa</i> on our left, and only missed the bows of our own boat
by a few yards. The second torpedo passed about 200 yards
ahead of the convoy. The course of the transports was immediately
altered and with a zig-zag route the boats hurried to
their berths just outside the narrow entrance of the inner harbour;
while the Japanese destroyers continued to drop depth-charges
around the suspected position of the German submarine. No
official result was published, but it was reported in Taranto that
the submarine was sunk by the explosion of the depth-charges.</p>

<p>The following day the <i>Indarra</i> moved through the narrow
channel into the inner harbour. So narrow is this entrance that
the sides of our troopship only missed the high walls on both
sides by a matter of five or six yards. In the inner harbour were
battleships of all sizes belonging to the Italian Navy, and one
marvelled how our allies could allow enemy submarines to lie in
wait just outside without any interference, for on our arrival
not a sign of an Italian warship was seen in the outer harbour.
In the peacefulness of the still waters of the inner harbour, which
was several square miles in area, we remained until the early
hours of the following morning, and just after dawn the Battalion
disembarked by means of lighters which carried us to the
temporary pier erected on the shallow beach near the British
Base Camp.</p>

<p>It was the 23rd of June, 1918. Just a year previously we had
landed in Egypt, and two years practically to the day since we
had left England for France. Once again our feet were on the
continent of Europe and we felt we had left the East for good.
We looked forward with no little anxiety to our coming return
to France, though many maintained that we were bound for the
Italian Trentino Front, and arriving at Taranto and not
Marseilles lent colour to this possibility.

<span class="medium">JOURNEY THROUGH ITALY AND FRANCE&mdash;RECONSTRUCTION&mdash;MOULLE&mdash;ST. SYLVESTER CAPPEL&mdash;MONT ROUGE&mdash;LOCRE&mdash;DRANOUTRE&mdash;MONT VIDAGNE.</span></h2>

<p>On arrival at the pier at Taranto beach a short march brought
us to our lines in the Base Camp. Only one day was spent here,
and the following evening we entrained for France. During the
day canteen stores were bought for the journey from the large
Expeditionary Force Canteen, but no leave into the town was
granted. Orders were issued for entraining that evening, and an
amusing paragraph appeared to the effect that troops were
requested not to refer to our gallant Allies, the Italians, as
“Italianoes,” “Ice-creamoes,” “Chip Potatoes,” etc. The
route by train was along the east coast of Italy, and the train
left the camp siding about 8 p.m. on the evening of the 24th
June, 1918.</p>

<p>The first part of the journey was practically along the seashore
and there was nothing of special note about the scenery. Halts
were made at Bari, Foggia, Termoli and Castellammare, which
town was reached about 1 p.m. on the 25th. By the following
midday we had reached Rimini, having passed through Ancona
and Pesaro en route. As far as Rimini the scenery had not been
above the average of the coastal scenery of Kent or Sussex, but
shortly after leaving the town the railroad branched inland
towards Faenza; and on this part of the journey the scenery was
beautiful, the countryside being rich with summer flowers of
bright colours, while the perfect blue of the sky overhead added
to the richness of the colour scheme. Faenza was reached by
4 p.m. on the 25th June, and a long halt was made in a siding and
men were permitted to leave the train and stretch their legs a
little. Hitherto the halts had been short and just long enough
to permit the issue of hot tea which had been prepared at wayside
cookhouses previous to our arrival. At Faenza the long halt of
several hours permitted officers to visit the town, where a decent
meal was procured at one of the hotels. Time also enabled
many of us to purchase and send home as souvenirs, pieces of
artistic pottery for which the town is noted. Early in the
evening the journey was resumed, and our next halt was made in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
the large station of Bologna, just after 8 p.m., when we caught a
passing glimpse of the quaint Cathedral and University in the
town. The people on the station cheered us as the train
pulled up; a decided change from the apathetic gaze which had
been our greeting from the southern Italians. While standing
in the station a long ambulance train full of wounded Italian
troops drew up alongside our train and fraternising between the
two armies commenced, cigarettes and souvenirs were exchanged,
and when the hospital train moved out we gave a hearty cheer
to our wounded allies. A short time afterwards our train
steamed out of Bologna, and by dawn the following morning we
were passing through the glorious mountain scenery of Northern
Italy. The train wended its way along deep valleys and pierced
through the long tunnels which are numerous in the Apennines.
The route taken was through Novi Liguire, Ronco to Sampierdarina,
just west of Genoa; the railway skirting the city at this
part of the journey. During the afternoon of the 27th we halted
at Savona where an enthusiastic crowd gathered and cheered
us; no doubt thinking that the Battalion was part of the British
Forces which had so materially assisted the Italians in their
recent victories on the Trentino Front. We did not disillusion
these kind people and accepted their flowers, fruits and,
cigarettes. From Savona the journey was continued along the
sea shore, and we enjoyed the beauty of the calm, blue, sunlit
Mediterranean on our left, and on the other hand the steep
cliffs covered with bright flowers and dotted here and there
with pretty little towns and beautiful gardens. At 11 p.m. that
night the train pulled up at Ventimiglia, the frontier station
where certain international formalities were gone through by the
railway officials. However, such things did not worry us, and we
spent the halt in the railway refreshment caf&eacute;s and buffets.
Unfortunately, the beauties of the Mentone-Cannes Riviera
were passed at night-time and the only excitement of the night
was the gamble in most carriages while we were passing Monte
Carlo. Early on the morning of the 28th June we reached the
outskirts of Marseilles. The railway ran along the north-eastern
side of the town on high ground, and a splendid view of
the harbour and city was obtained. From this point the route
went northwards via Miramas, Avignon, where we crossed the
Rhone to Le Tiel, which town we reached at 10.30 p.m. that
night, and obtained an excellent meal at the railway buffet.
The rest of the beauty of the Rhone Valley, which many of us
had enjoyed some eighteen months previously, was lost in the
darkness. Lyons was passed early the next morning, but it was
sufficiently light to obtain a splendid view of the city and its
bridges, which had been denied us in the outward journey to the
East. After passing through St. Germains au Mont D’or the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
railway branched off to the west and a long halt was made at
Paray-le-Monial, giving us the opportunity of exploring the
quaint provincial French town for about an hour, when the
journey was again resumed. During the night we passed
through Moulins, Nevers, and Gien, and on this part of the trip
we passed a train containing the London Scottish which had
been delayed owing to a fire breaking out in one of the trucks.
During the morning of the 30th June we arrived near Versailles
about 10 a.m., at which point the network of railways is extremely
intricate and hopes of passing through Paris were high at one
moment when we appeared to be travelling towards the capital,
only to be dashed to the ground the next when the train shot
over the points in quite a different direction. Over this network
of railway lines outside Versailles the train halted, shunted, went
forward, moved backwards until we became quite bewildered
as to the real direction of Paris, but when we eventually passed
through the station of Poissy it was settled once and for all that
we were not going near Paris. The day was beautifully warm
and every one was getting tired of this long train journey with
its constant jolting, when the train pulled up miles from nowhere.
Every one descended from the train to the fields alongside and
enjoyed a “leg stretch.” The signal was against us, and in
spite of the frantic whistle of the engine it did not fall. None
of the railway officials could account for the stoppage, so we
enjoyed the freedom of the fields for about two hours. Eventually,
however, the shrill whistle of the engine warned us that
the journey was to be continued, and as the train slowly moved,
every one made a dash for their truck. Every one was present
except two officers, and we all worried about their apparent
predicament or even perhaps their desertion. However, about
a mile further up the line the train pulled up and the two truants
appeared. Apparently they had gone off to a village further
up the line in search of luxuries in the shape of eggs, butter,
fruit, etc., and before leaving had made a compact with the
driver (no doubt with the aid of a few francs) to wait for them at
a given point if the train was permitted to pass the signal.
After this incident the train crawled along until the town of
Gisors was reached, and here the explanation of our delay was
apparent. The train in front of ours, carrying French troops and
transport, had run into a stationary engine in the station, and as
the result of the collision, several carriages had been smashed up
and the engine derailed, causing casualties among both troops
and horses. After some delay, which allowed us to visit the
caf&eacute;s in the town near the station, we proceeded on our journey,
and early on the 1st of July we passed through Etaples, where the
large British Cemetery brought back to us the real horrors of war
after a pleasant journey across the Mediterranean and the long
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
and interesting train ride through Italy and France. From
Etaples the journey to Boulogne was through a particularly dull
piece of country, and consisted of a continuous line of dumps,
hospitals, camps, hutments, ordnance depots, etc.</p>

<p>About midday on the 1st of July, 1918, the Battalion detrained
at Audricques, a large Royal Engineer locomotive repair
depot. The scenery at this place was not particularly pleasing;
all railheads are surrounded by the same old ration and ammunition
dumps, but the W.A.A.C.’s, whom we had never seen
before, brightened our lives at that particular moment. It
must be remembered that we had not seen a real fresh-complexioned
English girl for over two years. Not that I am
belittling the beauty of their French sisters or even the
particular charms of the girls of Italy, Macedonia, Egypt and
Palestine, but to us there were none to touch the homely loveliness
of the British girl.</p>

<p>Orders were soon issued by the new Divisional Staff which
had met us on our arrival, and we proceeded to billets at Moulle,
not an excessive distance, it is true, neither were the roads
dusty and rough like the tracks we had traversed out East, but
after a week in the train it was a trying march.</p>

<p>Here we were informed that we were to form part of the
30th Division which had been recently reconstructed and was
under the command of Major-General W. de Williams, C.M.G.,
D.S.O., and with the London Scottish and the Queen’s Westminsters
we were to form the 90th Infantry Brigade under
Brigadier-General G. A. Stevens, D.S.O.</p>

<p>The other two brigades in the Division were the 21st Brigade,
consisting of the 1/6th Cheshire Regiment, 2/23rd London
Regiment and the 7th Royal Irish Regiment, and the 89th
Brigade, containing the 2nd Battalion South Lancashire Regiment,
7/8th Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and the 2/17th London
Regiment.</p>

<p>The following extract from a brief history of the 30th Division
gives an idea of the state of affairs on our joining the Division:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The various units of the Division were collected together at the
beginning of July, occupying an area around Cassel, where Divisional
Headquarters were. But the Division was hardly ready to go into
the line without some training and preparation. This was particularly
the case since there were indications that the enemy was
going to attack again on the Kemmel-Hazebrouck Front. The
French troops holding the line between Kemmel and the Mont des
Cats had been relieved by British troops at the beginning of the
month, and the defensive systems still required a good deal of
attention, so that during the month of July the Division was busy
enough. The various battalions within the three Brigades of the
Division had to get to know each other. The various arms of the
Division had to learn to work together for defence and offence, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
Palestine Battalions had to accustom themselves to the warfare of
1918, which had changed since their departure for Salonica in 1916.
While the whole Division had to prepare for, and practise its r&ocirc;le
as Reserve Division to the 10th Corps with a series of counter-attack
programmes in the event of an enemy attack taking place. This
involved careful organisation and co-ordination of each arm for the
various situations that might arise, from the piercing of the line by
Mont Rouge, to a thrust on the south-western slopes of the Mont
des Cats.”</p></blockquote>

<p>From the 2nd of July to the 7th the Battalion was comfortably
billeted at Moulle and carried out intensive field training in
the neighbourhood. Our Battalion organisation was soon
revised and completed, and the Battalion was initiated into the
revised methods of warfare in France in 1918. Leave was
granted to the United Kingdom in limited numbers, it being in
most cases the first home leave for two years.</p>

<p>On the 7th of July the Battalion marched to La Nieppe,
between St. Omer and Cassel, and stayed there for the night.
The next morning the march was resumed as far as Eecke, where
the Battalion was billeted in a couple of large farms between
the villages of St. Sylvester Cappel and Eecke. The Battalion,
in common with the remainder of the Division, became responsible
for the defence of the reserve line at Coq de Paille, south-west
of Mont des Cats. Each day reconnaissances of the various
routes from our billets to the position, and also a complete study
of the system itself, was made by officers and N.C.O.’s. On
several occasions the Battalion marched up at night and manned
the trenches for practice purposes, while schemes for counter
attacks from the trenches were worked out and practised.
During the day field training was carried out with vigour, while
on those evenings when we were not detailed to march up to
the Coq de Paille defences for the night, Company concerts,
assisted by our own drum and fife band, which had again been
organised, were held. Except for the night time, when the
enemy persisted in shelling a dump of artillery ammunition
near our farms, our stay at Eecke was quite enjoyable. Leave
was still granted, and parties continued to leave each day for
the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>On the 13th of July we were inspected by General Plumer,
the Army Commander, who complimented us on our turn out&mdash;The
usual “splendid lot of men” business which we all know.</p>

<p>German attacks on our front were threatened to take place
on the 18th of July in the region of Mont Rouge, and the
Battalion was accordingly ordered to move up through Boeschepe
and was held in reserve for the night in the rear of Mont Rouge,
with orders to occupy and defend the line of reserve trenches
covering Berthen should the attack develop. However, beyond
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
the usual artillery fire the night was quiet, and we returned just
after daybreak to our billets near Eecke. Training was continued
for another week, and on the 25th the Battalion moved up to
the line near Mont Rouge and relieved the 17th Royal Scots in
the support trenches on the Locre sector. Nothing of special
interest occurred beyond the usual unpleasantness of trench
warfare. Movement by day was practically impossible owing
to the German observation from Mont Kemmel, on our left
front. For five days we remained in this sector of the line, and
were relieved on the night of the 30th by the 2/14th London
(Scottish) and marched back towards Boeschepe. We had
suffered a few casualties from shelling, but it was great experience
for the officers and men who had joined the Battalion since
its departure from the French front in 1916. Those of us who
remembered the old line at Neuville St. Vaast were struck by
the absence of those splendid dug-outs which we had occupied
during our first visit to France. On the 3rd of August the
Battalion moved back as far as St. Sylvester Cappel and enjoyed
a week’s rest.</p>

<p>At the end of the week the Battalion moved to the line and
took over the Locrehof sub-sector as supports, and were moved
up seven days later to the front line trenches, relieving the
London Scottish. Only two days were spent in the front line,
when we were relieved by the Queen’s Westminster Rifles and
returned from the line to Moth Farm, which lay midway between
Boeschepe and Godewaersvelde, and while in rest here it was
arranged that our Division should attack the Dranoutre Ridge.
We overlooked the German lines throughout their length from
the Mont Noir-Mont Rouge Ridge, but the Bosche had the
advantage in the possession of the Dranoutre Ridge, a long
spur running down from Mont Rouge through Locre, with
Dranoutre at its tip, which high ground represented, after
successive ebbings and flowings, the mark of the Hun tide of
advance there. This ridge, looking down as it did into our
front trenches, made approach by day almost impossible; and
it set bounds to movement, cooking and life there generally,
which only those who had to live there could properly
appreciate. The 35th Division, whom we had relieved, had
long ago made up their minds to take the ridge, but wet
weather set in and their patrols reported the going across
“No Man’s Land” impossible; it was therefore left for us to
accomplish.</p>

<p>The attack was fixed for the night of the 21st/22nd of August.
It entailed an advance of some 300 yards over swampy ground,
pocked with shell-holes, the crossing of the River Douvre here
a small stream, the ascent up through the straggling Wakefield
and Mowbray Woods to the crest, where stood two strongly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
fortified posts&mdash;the old farms of Romp and Locrehof&mdash;a total
advance of about 1,000 yards. The going was really difficult in
the last part, where to the usual tangle of rough grass, shell-holes
new and old, odds and ends of trenches and dug-outs was
added the presence of trees and some undergrowth, the navigation
of which even in daylight and without an enemy or the impedimenta
of attack requires a certain care.</p>

<p>The London Scottish represented the 90th Brigade in this
show, and that the attack was carried out with courage and
great credit is due to the 2/14th Londons, who showed that the
Palestine troops were equal to any demands that the Western
Front might make upon them.</p>

<p>During the night following the attack the Civil Service Rifles
relieved the Scottish in the captured line, which merely consisted
of odd shell holes, and there withstood a determined counter-attack
delivered by storm troops. Under continual heavy
artillery, trench mortar, and machine-gun fire, we helped to
consolidate the new front line. Fighting patrols were pushed
forward and great courage was displayed by members of the
2/15th, particularly Sergeant P. J. Kelly’s patrol, “C” Company,
at Locrehof Farm, and by Lieutenant H. J. Mallett’s patrol,
“D” Company.</p>

<p>Wakefield Wood, which was on our front, was heavily shelled
with gas shells, but this did not deter the Battalion, and on the
24th of August we drove off a determined counter-attack by the
Boche. Local fighting continued until the 26th; but the consolidation
of the line progressed, when the Battalion was withdrawn
and retired to the comparative security of the dug-outs
on Mont Rouge, and on the following day returned to our old
billet at Moth Farm for a couple of nights, when a return to
Mont Rouge was made.</p>

<p>On the 1st of September the enemy withdrew from Mont
Kemmel, and the British line was immediately pushed forward
as far as Daylight Corner, and close to Wulverghem. On the
night of the 3rd-4th of September we relieved the London
Scottish near Wulverghem, which was merely indicated by a
notice board with “This is Wulverghem,” and a few chipped
and broken tombstones which marked the site of the church.
Our orders were to carry on the same policy of advancing as far
as possible without a full-dress attack. But we were now up
against the outposts of the enemy’s main line of resistance; he
held the high ground, and furthermore the ground was of the
worst possible type for advance under fire. Hardly a yard of
it but had been wired at some time in one direction or another.
In fact, it looked exactly as if the wire had taken root and spread
like brambles. What was not wire was shell-holes or old
trenches full, or perhaps only half full, of water. Any advance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
at all was creditable. There was, too, from this time a noticeable
increase in artillery fire of all calibres, with a fair amount
of gas from our line back beyond Daylight Corner to beyond
Kemmel. Wulverghem and Daylight Corner succeeded Locre
and Canada Corner as targets, with Kemmel as a substitute
for the Mont Rouge Hills. Thus, though the left company of
the 2/15th Londons managed on the 4th to advance their right
about 200 yards and establish new posts east of Wulverghem,
efforts during the night of the 4th-5th yielded little in the way
of progress, but more in the way of heroism when Private Cleaver
stayed by his wounded comrade in “No Man’s Land” until
they were found two or three days later. But even as this bald
outline suggests, there was plenty of work and opportunity for
both leadership and initiative, whether on the part of the Company
Commander, e.g., Captain Andrew, whose bold reconnaissances
were of as great value to his Company as to the Battalion,
or on the part of the Platoon Commanders&mdash;Sergeant E. G.
Ward, “B” Company, who held on all day in an isolated
position far ahead of the general line, or Private Shepherd,
“D” Company, who specially distinguished himself by keeping
up communication under fire between his own platoon,
which was isolated in front, and his Company. On the
night of the 5th-6th we were relieved by the Queen’s
Westminsters and marched back to Donegal Farm, at the foot
of Mont Kemmel, leaving the 2/16th to carry on our work of
“peaceful penetration.” After a couple of days’ stay here we
marched back as far as Mont Vidagne, where our rest consisted
of furnishing strong working parties for road making and clearing
up the area near Westoutre. The Battalion transport and
Quartermaster’s Stores moved up from Nonne Bosch, near
Godewaersvelde, which had been their home since the beginning
of August, to a place just west of Westoutre. Not only had this
rear headquarters provided us with rations and letters regularly
while we were in the line, but they had prepared for us a concert
party, a revival of the original “Plumes,” who had worked hard
and got together an excellent programme under the able leadership
of Lieutenant K. P. Neall, our assistant Quartermaster.
A full-dress rehearsal was given in a marquee on the 14th of
September on the rear slopes of Mont Vidagne. Other units of
the Brigade were invited and gave the party a great reception.
One must remember that although the party did not reach the
excellence of a London theatre, or even the “Barnstormers”
(one of our Egyptian Divisional concert parties), it was composed
of men of the transport and Quartermaster’s staff who came up
the line each night with rations and shared with the Battalion
the unpleasantness of enemy artillery fire and aerial bombing
raids. It was not a party of selected entertainers who retired
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
from the fray for the sole purpose of becoming efficient music-hall
artists.</p>

<p>On the 16th the Battalion was moved to Mont Noir and
Major Benk&eacute; assumed command.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> Working parties still continued
to work in the Westoutre area, while parties of officers were
detailed to make a thorough reconnaissance of the line just
beyond Wulverghem and facing Messines Ridge, with a view of
relieving the 6th Cheshire Regiment. However, this work was
in vain, orders for the relief were cancelled, and we were ordered
to move farther south and occupy the support area on the
Neuve Eglise Sector, taking over from the Royal Inniskilling
Fusiliers.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>On the 19th of September the Battalion marched from Mont
Vidagne over the captured area as far as Bailleul, which town was
now completely devastated, and then turning east arrived at
Neuve Eglise about midnight. The relief was carried out
successfully, although everyone was tired after their march of
some ten or eleven miles.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XL">CHAPTER XL<br />

<span class="medium">NEUVE EGLISE&mdash;MESSINES&mdash;HOUTHEM&mdash;WYTSCHAETE</span></h2>

<p>In the Neuve Eglise area the Companies were spread over a
considerable area, the whole of which was under the direct
observation from the German lines on Messines Ridge. “A”
Company was in immediate support to the London Scottish,
who were in the line on Hill 63, north of Ploegsteert Wood, while
the remaining three Companies were dotted along the defensive
line of trenches just east of the village of Neuve Eglise. The
Battalion was under orders to garrison this reserve line should
the Bosche make an attack on our immediate front. Movement,
of course, during daylight was restricted, and at the slightest
sign of smoke the enemy would deluge the area with shells, and
during one of these strafes “B” Company had to move its home
further back, but not without suffering a few casualties. “A”
and “C” Company were also unfortunate one night while
furnishing working parties in the line, and several of their men
were killed and wounded during an enemy bombardment of
Hill 63. On the whole, however, a quiet time was spent in
this area, and the Battalion was ordered up the line on the
26th of September. We relieved the 6/7th Inniskillings and
took over the line in front of Messines town from the right of the
main road from Wulverghem to Messines. Headquarters was
situated near South Midland Farm, “A” Company were in the
front line on the sector adjoining the road, and “C” Company
on their right, having Stinking Farm as their right flank. “B”
Company provided supports to both front Companies, while
“D” Company were held in reserve behind South Midland
Farm. The intention was that within a few days the Battalion,
in conjunction with other units, should attack and capture
Messines Ridge, so that the first days in the line were spent
in reconnoitring our front, from which it was learnt that the
enemy had a plentiful supply of machine guns. At night-time
we were also busy in bringing up and distributing stores which are
peculiar to an organised attack, such as red lights, Verey pistols
and so forth. To recapture the ridge was less an operation by
itself than an operation supplementary to a much larger attack
further north.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span></p>

<p>The 2/16th Queen’s Westminsters were on our right and the
2/17th Londons on our left. The main road from Wulverghem
to Messines formed the general line of the direction of our
attack. On the Divisional front the first objectives were some
enemy strong points close to our front line, and directly in
front of our Battalion were three such strongholds, viz., Big
Bull Cottage, Boyles Farm and Rome Alley. The attack was
timed for dawn on the 28th, and at 5.30 a.m. our artillery opened
up their bombardment on our front. It was not a creeping
barrage, which had by that time become fairly perfect, but was
rather a treatment of carefully-selected places and areas to cover
the advance of our Companies on their allotted strong points
to be attacked. Both our attacking Companies got well off the
mark under this artillery preparation and possessed themselves
of their objectives, the greatest resistance coming from Big
Bull Cottage, where most of the occupants were killed, and
before 7 a.m. the Battalion had claimed seventeen prisoners and
nine machine guns. The Battalion on our left were also successful
in capturing Mortar Farm and Ontario Farm. This clearing
of the way for the advance to the Messines Ridge, though perhaps
more an affair of fighting patrols than a staged attack, called
for a good deal of initiative on the part of Company, Platoon
and Subordinate Commanders in rushing and getting around
machine guns when even the mere covering of the ground alone
presented considerable difficulties. All the enemy strong points
to be attacked had the armaments of machine guns, Captain
Peatfield’s Company, “A,” our left attacking Company, accounting
for six, Second-Lieutenant Pittam leading the platoon that
captured them. Lance-Sergeant P. Mason, of “A” Company,
mopped up a post of four with no little dash and skill, helped
by the daring reconnaissances of the previous night, in which
Private J. Volke had a notable share.</p>

<p>“C” Company (Captain F. H. Du Heaume) had also pushed
forward and captured a network of trenches known as Rome
Alley, driving off the garrison and killing a few of the enemy,
while their patrols afterwards pushed towards Gabion Farm,
which was strongly held by the enemy. Against this strong
point “C” Company had to form a defensive flank, as the 2/16th
Battalion had not advanced in the first stage of the day’s operations.
No determined counter-attack was made on our front,
although the enemy was active with his snipers and machine
guns.</p>

<p>“B” Company moved forward during the attack from their
position in support and occupied our original front line, while
“D” Company was brought up to occupy the support line
vacated by “B” Company.</p>

<p>The new front was then held pending the result of the greater
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
attack taking place further north, while on our right the 2/16th
Battalion (Queen’s Westminsters) assisted during the afternoon
on the left flank of the attack of the 31st Division through
Ploegsteert Wood, which met with considerable resistance, and
the Westminsters suffered considerable casualties. The actual
attack took place about 3 p.m. in the afternoon of the 28th,
and turned out to be no easy task. The element of surprise
which had assisted us was of course entirely lacking, and the
progress of the troops on our right was attended with difficulties,
and the Bosche made a determined stand, but under pressure
gradually gave way.</p>

<p>By this time the success of the operations further north had
begun to tell and, pressed on his right flank as well as in front,
the enemy began to withdraw over the ridge in the late afternoon.
His passage over the ridge, which of course was visible,
was hastened by our artillery and machine-gun fire, which the
sight of the enemy on the run in broad daylight naturally provoked.
More than that, the Division could now, while still
preserving the role of flanking the attack further north, push
on to the ridge. Orders were accordingly issued for further
patrols to advance over the ridge in the evening and secure a
line east of Messines itself, curving back on the right to keep in
touch with the troops there. This implied following the dip into
the hollow of the Steenbecque River and its steepish rise to the
top of the ridge, the whole way a pitted and torn desolation of
the familiar type. Progress in the dark&mdash;it was pitch dark that
night&mdash;was necessarily slow over such ground.</p>

<p>During the late afternoon and the evening our advance
companies pushed forward, meeting small resistance from the
enemy’s rearguards. “A” Company on the left were able to
push forward past Hospice Mill and actually entered the ruined
village of Messines before midnight. The advance of “C”
Company was necessarily slower as the troops on our right were
held up, and it became necessary for us to form a defensive flank.
Unfortunately, it was found inadvisable to hold the village of
Messines, as the Battalion on our left had also met some strong
resistance, and the salient which we formed became particularly
unpleasant and it was ordered that we should withdraw from
the village itself and occupy Hospice Mill, on the western outskirts,
where “B” Company had pushed out in support of
“A” Company during the advance to the village. In view of
the advance being continued the following day, it was decided
that “D” Company should relieve “A” Company in the front
line, and “B” Company should continue as supports and “A”
and “C” Companies be held in Battalion reserve. Great credit
is due to all concerned for the excellent manner in which this
reorganisation was carried out on such a dark night and over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
strange country covered with shell-holes, trenches and with
entanglements. The first day’s work had been very successful.</p>

<p>Our casualties were comparatively small when one realises
the advance we had made, and most of them were the result of
heavy artillery fire which had continued all day on our old
front line, and, curious as it may seem, Headquarters suffered
most, one unlucky shell killing nine and wounding five others
seriously. Amongst those killed by this shell was our R.S.M.
H. W. Lovelock, well known to both the 1st and 2nd Battalions.</p>

<p>By daylight on the 29th, however, the ridge was ours for the
taking, and in the heavy mist at dawn parties of the Battalion
pushed forward and by seven o’clock were in the village and
over the ridge. Messines, with its memories of four years’
fighting, passed into British hands again, and this time for good.
There was, indeed, little else than memories, save the jagged
cairn which had been the church, the ruined houses which had
been made into concrete blockhouses, some of them left intact,
or nearly so, and a few broken tombstones on the site of the
cemetery. The Messines Ridge in the chill of a misty, late September
morning, when you have been fighting since dawn the day
before, and do not know where in the mist the enemy is hidden,
provides neither time nor the place for philosophising. The
ridge, from being an objective, became merely a road to the
valley of the Lys. Somewhere there, as not infrequently in
the history of Flanders, we might expect a stand to be made.
The task of the Division was to see that it was made as far east
of the ridge as possible&mdash;at any rate, as far as the line of the
Ypres-Comines Canal, so well known and so little loved in the
Salient farther north.</p>

<p>In order to carry out this idea the Battalion was ordered to
push forward at dawn and advance as far as Houthem, and if
possible make for the line of the Canal, a distance of over three
miles. Except for constant artillery fire the first mile of the
advance on our actual front was carried out with few losses to
ourselves. However, we soon came under the direct observation
of the captive balloons behind the German lines, and his artillery
fire became heavier and well directed.</p>

<p>As no other British troops were to be seen over the ridge
it was decided to halt about 2.0 p.m., and while waiting for
further developments we had the pleasure of seeing one of our
airmen bring down two of the enemy balloons in flames. They
were immediately replaced by another balloon, but its life was
short and the airman returned and downed it. An enemy
plane, flying low, came over our position, but luckily no
artillery fire resulted.</p>

<p>Just after 2.0 p.m. we saw a British skirmishing line advance
on our left, and patrols soon got in touch, to find that it was the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
2nd Battalion of the South Lancashires, of the 89th Brigade,
who had pushed through the 2/17th Londons and taken up the
pursuit. After consultation between the two Battalion commanders
it was decided to push on together towards Houthem
Church, as the 2nd South Lancashires were in touch with a
Battalion of the 41st Division on their left. On our right matters
were not so clear, and the heavy machine-gun fire confirmed
our idea that the Boche was making a stand. The first part of
our advance from Messines was over ground which had been
in our hands the previous winter, while the latter half was enemy
territory and unknown to us. The “going” down the slope was
easier than on the west side of the ridge, though still a desolation
of rank grass and old shell-holes. Houses, of course, there were
none. Remnants of trenches and wire entanglements still
served to remind us of the former British front line area. The
only solid things were the pill-boxes left vacant, and in many
cases intact, by the retreating enemy. By our rapid advance
we were able to materially assist the advance of the 41st Division
on our left by outflanking the enemy machine-gunners.</p>

<p>On our right the advance had been taken up by the London
Scottish, and during the night of the 29th of September they
entered Warneton.</p>

<p>After we had linked up with the South Lancashires we were
able to push forward without meeting much opposition, and lost
only a few men wounded. When darkness came we had reached
the Ypres-Comines Canal, and took up a defensive line near
the Canal near Houthem, turning our right flank to face south,
as we had not at that time obtained touch with our troops on
the right. We used the numerous pill-boxes as rain began to
fall, and except for intermittent artillery fire and an occasional
burst of machine-gun fire which caused us a few casualties, the
night was quiet. Signal communication by lamp was obtained
with Brigade Headquarters on Messines Ridge. By dawn on
the 30th of September our right flank was secured by the Queen’s
Westminsters who arrived during the night, and the Brigade
formed the extreme right of the great advance which was proceeding
successfully from the banks of the Lys to the north.
The River Lys forming a protection to the retiring enemy made
it necessary for a great deal of preliminary work to be done
before any advance in that direction could be undertaken.</p>

<p>Next day brought no further advance on our front, the 30th
Division was flanking an attack rather than making one, and
so regulated its movements to those of the forces on the left
where the line went away north-east towards Gheluwe and
onwards. We were free to close up the tail of the Division behind
Messines Ridge, to improve shelter where there was none&mdash;which
was practically everywhere&mdash;to clear roads, and to count
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
the spoil. The number of prisoners taken was small, but if
there is a peculiar pleasure in capturing guns which have shelled
you for days and nights together, that pleasure was ours, for
the Division took four 8-inch howitzers, three 5&middot;9-inch howitzers,
one 5&middot;9-inch gun, three 4&middot;2-inch howitzers and a similar number
of guns, and 24 field guns. Any one who cared might possess
himself of a trench-mortar or a machine-gun with sufficient
ammunition for a month’s fighting. The whole battlefield was,
in fact, strewn with material from trench boards to 15-inch
“duds”&mdash;relics of the British bombardment the previous year.
The only road for transport and guns was the Wulverghem-Messines
road. A very large crater completely demolishing it
had been blown just east of the Steenbecque, where the road
ran over an embankment. The enemy had also placed 36 tank
mines across the road. These were all removed and the crater
bridged to take lorry traffic by midday on the 29th of September.
On the morning of the 30th the Divisional front, which had been
gradually lessened in width by the advance from the north of
the 41st Division and on the south by the 31st Division, was
handed over to the reserve Brigade (the 21st Brigade) and the
Battalion was withdrawn and marched back to Messines Ridge,
and occupied old Hun dug-outs and pill-boxes near Blauen
Mullen, where Colonel Gaze rejoined from leave. Our rest,
however, was soon disturbed, and the area was heavily shelled,
causing casualties, especially among the men of “B” Company,
and after a short and unpleasant stay on this part of the ridge
the Battalion moved to Oosttaverne Wood, a little farther north.
The march proved exciting, as a Boche plane came over our
lines and cleverly set fire to five of our observation balloons in
such quick fashion that no less than ten airmen were parachuting
to earth at the same time.</p>

<p>Oosttaverne Wood proved a very desolate spot, and it was
with great difficulty that the Battalion obtained sufficient
cover from the cold weather. Most of the dug-outs and pill-boxes
in this devastated wood were under water. However,
being free from enemy observation and the consequent artillery
fire made up a great deal for the discomfort. A few days later
the Battalion went farther back towards Wytschaete, where a
fairly clean area was found and better accommodation was
discovered. It was a restful time and some of the more energetic
members of the Battalion journeyed to Ypres to see the “sights.”
Lieutenant-Colonel A. W. Gaze, M.C., left the Battalion for a
Senior Officers’ Course at Camberley, and the command of the
Battalion was given to Lieutenant-Colonel A. C. H. Benk&eacute;, M.C.

<span class="medium">AMERICA CORNER&mdash;THE ATTACK&mdash;CROSSING THE LYS&mdash;BOUS&mdash;BECQUE&mdash;RONCQ&mdash;THE PURSUIT TOWARDS THE RIVER SCHELDT&mdash;PETIT TOURCOING&mdash;AVELGHEM&mdash;THE ARMISTICE&mdash;COURTRAI AREA&mdash;MARCH OVER DEVASTATED AREA VIA ARMENTIERES&mdash;BOESINGHEM&mdash;BASE DUTIES&mdash;THE END.</span></h2>

<p>On the 11th of October, 1918, the Battalion left their camp
near Wytschaete and marched to take over the line at America
Corner, about 1&frac12; miles north of Wervicq. This relief entailed
a long march of about 12 miles. The first part was done during
the morning, when a halt was made under the cover of a small
ridge about a mile west of Houthem. The weather was fine
and the enemy artillery did not bother us on this part of the
journey. On the way we passed two derelict British Tanks,
relics of our advance in 1917. From the halt advance parties
of an officer and a few N.C.O.’s from each Company went forward,
but it was not until dusk that the Battalion was able to
continue their march over the canal bridge at Houthem and
thence via Tenbrilen. The roads were difficult, and as the
country had been in enemy hands many new tracks and roads
had been made, and, together with the darkness and the inevitable
rain which accompanies most marches, attacks and reliefs, the
latter part of the journey became very trying. The advance
parties who left earlier in the day came under very heavy
artillery fire near their destination, and were met by large parties
of British troops who had been “gassed”&mdash;an unpleasant omen.
The whole area near America Corner was soaked with gas, and
the place was littered with dead horses. The Headquarters
of the Battalion we were to relieve had been reduced to the
Commanding Officer, who lay on the floor of the dug-out blinded
by the gas, while practically all the remainder of Headquarters
Company had suffered from the gas shells and had been evacuated.
The R.A.M.C. men, who were busy in this gas-stricken zone,
which was still being shelled when the advance parties of our
Battalion arrived, deserved the highest praise for their devotion
to duty. Here, indeed, was a pleasant outlook, and before
the Battalion had arrived some of our own advance party had
suffered and had to be evacuated, including Acting R.S.M. Dyer,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
who, unfortunately, was killed later on in the day, an enemy
shell landing right on the ambulance car in which he was travelling
some six miles farther back. In the evening heavy rain
fell, and the Battalion struggled in the dark along the shelled
roads which were now covered in thick mud. About 11 p.m.
the Battalion arrived at America Corner, and fortunately at
that time when the shelling had diminished, only to learn that
the Battalions in the line on both flanks were just about to
raid the Boche lines. Before the Companies could form up
under their guides, a heavy artillery duel opened up, and, of
course, every one took immediate cover wherever possible.
Luckily only a few minor casualties resulted, and the relief was
continued. The Battalion, however, had practically no time
to learn anything of their new surroundings before daybreak,
as the enemy continued to shell the area throughout the night.
When dawn came it was found that we were under observation
from the Boche trenches, and that Battalion Headquarters
was only a matter of 250 yards from the front enemy trenches,
and overlooked by Wervicq Church, where the enemy had an
Observation Post. Not that there is anything particularly
daring about this fact, but Battalion Headquarters is always
the centre of attraction for thousands of runners from rear
authorities, asking for the quantity of jam, etc., when the real
thing to be considered is the enemy artillery and the preparation
for the coming attack. Besides, constant callers always make
a place conspicuous, even if that place is in a quiet suburban
street, and with the perfect observation of the enemy we had
no desire to become conspicuous. Throughout the day the
enemy continued to shell the area, devoting much of his
“gaseous” attentions on America Corner. Two days were
given to us to acquaint ourselves with this sector, and as no
movement was possible by day it meant a great deal of night
work and practically no rest.</p>

<p>The night before the attack rations were brought up on pack
mules by our Quartermaster, Captain Joslin, and his assistant,
Lieutenant Wright. Both these officers found great difficulty
in persuading the mules to come up with the rations, and the
prospect of being heavily shelled on the return journey while
in charge of these stupid animals was not encouraging for them.
However, they were soon relieved; an orderly put his head
into the pill-box entrance and gravely informed them that a
shell had just arrived and disposed of their four-footed friends.
Wright had a leave warrant for England on the morrow in his
pocket, yet he came up to this inferno just to wish us “Cheerio
and Good Luck,” although his attendance was not officially
necessary.</p>

<p>The attack was ordered for dawn on the 14th of October,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
and the artillery opened up a most terrific barrage at 5.30 a.m.,
and after a four minute bombardment of the enemy front lines
the attack was launched under the same heavy volume of artillery
fire which gradually crept forward. “Jumping-off” lines had
been laid out the previous night, and from these the Battalion
advanced close on the creeping barrage in which a great number
of smoke shells were used. Within 30 minutes of the commencement
of the attack, German prisoners poured into our lines;
apparently under this fierce artillery fire they had made very
little resistance in the front line. No less than 313 prisoners,
including 9 officers, passed through our Battalion Headquarters
within a half-hour.</p>

<p>The 2/14th attacked on our left and with us were successful
in reaching the first objectives near the railway line from Wervicq
to Menin.</p>

<p>Some individual cases of gallantry reported were: Sergeant
B. Coultard, “B” Company, who, with his Platoon, did yeoman
work, and rounded up 45 of the enemy; Corporal C. D. Lodge,
“C” Company, with his men cleared the wire defences of a
strong point and carried it; Private Oakes, “D” Company,
single-handed rushed an enemy pill-box, put 14 of the enemy
out of action, with rifle and bombs and then took 10 prisoners.
Lance-Corporal J. Barnsfather, “B” Company, and Corporal
W. J. Mash, “D” Company, were not far behind in their performances.</p>

<p>All along the line the first rush had succeeded, and under
cover of a barrage from our artillery the Battalion halted and
consolidated in preparation for a counter-attack. While the
attack was proceeding all occupied areas behind the Boche lines
were bombarded with a great number of gas shells. Although
the resistance from the Boche troops was small, their artillery
was not slow in replying to our fire, and a heavy bombardment
of the British lines was soon in full swing.</p>

<p>The next step was to exploit this initial success and to push
on up to and, if possible, across, the River Lys, whilst the enemy
was still disorganised and his guns on the move. On the right
this involved the clearing of Wervicq, in whose narrow streets
and half broken-down houses there were still a good many
machine-guns and snipers. By this time the mist and smoke
had gone, and the advance was entirely uncovered in any way,
for there was practically no ground cover here. Patrols pushed
out towards the Lys as soon as the first objective was gained
were held up by machine-gun fire, and, in part, by the old wire
that still remained.</p>

<p>From the newly-captured position the ground on our direct
front sloped gradually to the River Lys, and it was devoid of
all cover; in daylight it was impossible to push forward without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
incurring unnecessary casualties. In the dusk, however, patrols
pushed out and found that the enemy had retired to the farther
bank of the river, but had destroyed all the bridges by fire.
About midnight, however, “A” Company, under Captain
Du Heaume, were able to make a crossing by a bridge which had
not been quite destroyed, just to the right of our direct front,
and afterwards he was able to take his Company along the
farther bank and form a bridgehead near Bousbecque. Under
cover of this bridgehead the Sappers, under Major Atkinson, R.E.,
placed a pontoon bridge across the river, though during the
whole of its construction the work was hindered by artillery
and machine-gun fire. Just after dawn the remainder of the
Battalion crossed the river and occupied Bousbecque, a village
which had been badly damaged by our artillery.</p>

<p>We cleared the village and in the early morning were able
to form a defensive line on the far outskirts. It was, however,
impossible for us to push on any farther, as we were held up
on our direct front by a heavily-wired line of trenches known as
the Linselles Switch. Furthermore, on our right the situation
was not quite clear and heavy fighting was in progress, while
the London Scottish on our left were unable to effect a crossing
of the Lys owing to the flat nature of the ground to their front,
which was swept by machine-gun fire from the high factories
on the farther bank nearer Menin. Later in the day, however,
the 14th Division had forced a crossing near Wervicq, and were
able to push up on our right, and on this flank the enemy
gradually withdrew. During the afternoon the London Scottish
came over to their right and crossed our pontoon bridge and
came into Bousbecque. By this time the enemy had left the
Linselles Switch under our pressure, and we were able to occupy
the high ground east of the village of Bousbecque from Mont
D’Halluin to Roncq. The line was continued on our right by
the 31st Division which had then pushed through the 14th
Division, while on our left the 2/16th Londons (Queen’s Westminsters)
continued the line north-east as far as Reckem, having
experienced some hard fighting in crossing the Lys just
south of Menin by means of rafts made from old doors,
duck-boards, etc. In the evening the London Scottish moved
from Bousbecque to Roncq for the night, when they were
ordered to continue the pursuit next morning after their
night’s rest.</p>

<p>During the night of the 17th of October the Battalion held
the Mont D’Halluin&mdash;Roncq outpost line, but as the Boche was
retreating fast and was not expected to make a real stand until
he reached the River Scheldt, the night was peaceful, and the
civilians in the neighbourhood gave our men a hearty welcome.
In the farm occupied by Battalion Headquarters the Hun had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
left his playing cards on the table in the middle of a game, while
at the piano were fragments of German songs.</p>

<p>The next morning the London Scottish continued the pursuit
on the Brigade front, while the 2/15th and 2/16th followed
in their wake in column of route, as far as Kruistraat. Not
until passing this village did the 2/14th meet any opposition,
but on the ridge a couple of miles beyond were many well-placed
and concealed enemy machine-guns which arrested their progress.
According to plan the Scottish were to have passed over this
ridge that day, but in view of this enemy rear-guard were unable
to do so. In spite of this temporary hold-up, however, our own
Battalion was ordered to billet in farms practically in the firing
line. Remarkable as it may seem, the London Scottish support
Company was actually behind our Battalion Headquarters,
where we were enjoying a nice hot meal, and slept in comfortable
beds.</p>

<p>During the night while we slept, however, the 2/14th pushed
over the ridge, and the next day we resumed our march forward.
Except for the visit of a Boche plane which flew over our column
and was brought down by Lewis gun fire, the journey to Aelbeke
was without incident. That night we were in comfortable
billets in private houses and farms near the town which had
been untouched by the ravages of war. The stationmaster
where the writer was billeted produced an English Grammar
which he had studied for this “day” when British troops
should arrive, and consequently spent the evening in questioning
us in his laboured English.</p>

<p>On the following days the advance was continued by the
2/14th and 2/16th Battalions, and except for a slight check at
Rollinghem, where the enemy had two field guns firing from
the market place, little opposition was met. On the 20th these
advance Battalions had reached the high ground at St. Genois
overlooking the Scheldt, the patrols of the London Scottish
actually reaching the banks of the river that night. However,
the enemy resistance showed signs of increase, and heavy artillery
fire from the farther banks of the river informed us that the
Boche was making a stand here. On the same night the Battalion
moved forward towards Petit Tourcoing, and were billeted in
the farm-houses just behind the St. Genois Ridge.</p>

<p>The advance being held up by the German defences on the
east bank of the Scheldt, the Brigade was withdrawn from the
line and remained in billets in the Petit Tourcoing area until
the end of the month. As much rest as possible was given to
the troops, and in the fine autumn weather sports and football
were indulged in. The countryside had not been destroyed
by war, and looked very clean and beautiful after the desolation
of the Messines area, where the ebb and flow of the fighting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
had destroyed nature for miles around. During our stay here
the 30th Divisional Concert Party (“The Optimists”) gave us
an excellent evening’s entertainment in one of the large barns,
and except for a few practice attacks over the open we had a
restful time. The appearance of home-made rafts on a local
pond at the end of the month, however, made us think seriously
of watery graves in the Scheldt.</p>

<p>On the 1st of November we were ordered to take over the
line at Avelghem on the Scheldt, and after a trying march we
relieved a Battalion of the King’s Royal Rifles. Although our
approach march was disturbed by enemy shelling we suffered
no casualties. Avelghem itself was on the banks of the Scheldt
and was overlooked by the Mont D’Enclus (150 feet) on the
farther bank. Previous to our recent advance the town had
been a peaceful market town, but now it was battered to the
ground by the German artillery, and the last few civilians were
leaving in haste when we arrived. The line held by the Battalion
was on the bank of the river in front of the town and extended
north as far as Rugge, where a bridgehead on the farther bank
had been established.</p>

<p>The care of the bridgehead was entrusted to “B” Company,
under Captain Lewis, while the remaining Companies occupied
cellars in the town and in the farm-houses near by. Our days
were spent underground, as the Boche had complete observation
of our lines, but at night our transport brought up rations, and
we prepared ourselves for the next day under the ground. Each
morning just before dawn the enemy barraged our position
with a heavy artillery “strafe”&mdash;no doubt anticipating a
further attack from us.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 3rd of November, the Boche concentrated
his attentions on Avelghem Church, and in about six hours of
constant shelling reduced a most beautiful building into absolute
ruin. The following day the Battalion was relieved, and returned
as far as Knocke, about four miles farther back. After a night’s
rest here a further move was expected and in the evening orders
were actually received from Brigade. Billeting parties left
for the new area and commenced their work. The Battalion
soon followed, accompanied by the inevitable rain, only to be
turned back on reaching the new area to find that the change
had been cancelled. When we returned to our former homes
we found another unit occupying the best places, and it was with
difficulty that we found accommodation. However, this crowding
only lasted for one night, and the next morning we moved
still farther back, a distance of about six miles, just to the north
of Belleghem.</p>

<p>On the 9th of November the enemy evacuated Mont D’Enclus,
and the next day we were brought forward towards the Scheldt as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
far as Heerstert, just west of Avelghem. On arriving in the village
we found it full of troops and heard rumours that British cavalry
had passed through earlier in the day. At the same time, however,
a German Taube was hovering overhead, and we anticipated a
bombing raid that night. We realised that the Boche had
retired so far that his artillery was unlikely to trouble us, but
we hated this inquisitive ’plane circling overhead.</p>

<div id="i369" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i369.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>That night rumours of an Armistice became prevalent. Every
one turned out of his billet and, led by our Drum and Fife Band,
we paraded up and down the main street of the village. In
the midst of this excitement, however, news came from Brigade
that no official news had been received confirming the rumoured
cessation of hostilities, and this so depressed us that we gradually
faded away one by one to our billets. The next morning ordinary
routine was pursued, and no one dared to utter the word “armistice”
without receiving disparaging remarks from his hearers.</p>

<p>About 9.0 a.m., however, the official telegram came through
and the rumour of the previous night was confirmed. All the
excitement of an armistice, however, had been squashed the
previous night; the sting had gone. During the afternoon
a thanksgiving service was held in the local church. The
Battalion remained at Heerstert until the 15th November, and
many took advantage of the opportunity of visiting the enemy
defences on the banks of the Scheldt under more peaceful conditions
than anticipated. A couple of large fatigue parties
were furnished for work at Escanaffles on the east of the river,
but difficulty arose with regard to the supply of rations, etc.,
and the Battalion was withdrawn and marched back to the
St. Annes Area, south of Courtrai, which had now become an
important railhead.</p>

<p>The rest here was much appreciated, and beyond the passing
of military transport there were no signs of war. Parades were
held in the morning, but the remainder of the day was devoted
to games, chiefly football. Passes to Courtrai were freely
granted.</p>

<p>A ceremonial parade for the presentation of medal ribbons
was held on the 26th of November on the local aerodrome,
and beyond the preparation for this parade little demand was
made on the energy of the troops.</p>

<p>On the 30th of November orders were received to move back
still further to the St. Omer area, and this necessitated a five
days’ trek. The first day’s halt was made at Linselles, where
we saw the terrible effect of the British artillery fire during the
attack over the River Lys in October, and also the wanton
destruction of the Hun hordes, who had deliberately broken
furniture and mirrors, and had slashed the covering from upholstered
furniture. The night’s billets were very uncomfortable,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
but as it was for one night only no one troubled. The next day
we proceeded to Verlighem, and here we were quartered in an
extensive hut encampment which the Germans had cleverly
concealed from aerial observation, in a thick wood. A comfortable
night was spent here in the bunks so recently vacated
by our enemies. All along the route to this point were signs
of the hurried retreat of the Boche, and we wondered why he
had left such strongly-defended points with so little real resistance.
In places the wire entanglements were 30 yards in depth,
through which no troops could advance without a terrible
massacre. The third day’s journey took us to Armentieres,
and it was appalling to see this great town practically razed
to the ground. Undoubtedly the retiring Hun had blown up
many of the fine buildings and churches by mines, and except
for a few French troops wandering about the ruins, there was
no sign of human habitation. The day’s march ended at Sailly-sur-la-Lys,
and here in absolute desolation the cover of dug-outs
and tumble-down buildings, the Battalion rested for the night.
Opposite Battalion Headquarters on the main road was a huge
German cemetery containing no less than nine thousand numbered
graves; a grim relic of the heavy fighting in this area in March,
1918, the dates on the crosses being evidence of the period. Many
French peasants were wandering aimlessly over the fields, looking
for their lost treasures, and it was pathetic to see them building
temporary homes with the old material, such as ammunition
boxes, corrugated iron, biscuit tins, and so forth, which littered
the old battlefield. The following morning the march was
continued through Estaires and Merville, and the same devastation
greeted us all round. It was not until evening time,
when approaching St. Venant, that we met occupied farms
where the occupants carried out their daily toil regardless of
the adjoining desolation. A short journey on the 4th of December
just south of the Nieppe Forest brought us to our
destination at Boesinghem, a few miles north-east of Aire, when
Lieutenant-Colonel Gaze rejoined from England, and again
took over the command. Billets were soon arranged, and
improved on our acquaintance&mdash;combined with hard work
and cleaning, which did a great deal towards this improvement.
Arrangements were immediately made for Christmas time, and
when the 25th of December arrived everything was carried out
with great success, although doubts were entertained until the
very last minute as to whether the goods would arrive in time.
At Boesinghem touch with our 1st Battalion in the Lillers area
was obtained, and inter-Battalion football matches were arranged.</p>

<p>From this time the Battalion commenced to fade away.
The fighting over, demobilisation set in, and every day some
familiar faces left the Battalion to re-enter civil life. Early
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
in January the Battalion moved to Etaples, where, after a stay
of about nine days, they entrained for the Dunkirk area and
encamped at Mardyck. In February the Battalion, much
depleted in strength, developed into a “General Purposes”
Battalion, and carried out Base duties. In the following month
they were relieved of these duties, and moved to Pont de Petite
Synthe, only to be moved again by train to the Etaples area,
first staying at Dannes and then at St. Cecile Plage.</p>

<p>From here “C” and “D” Companies were detailed for
duty at a Prisoner of War Camp near Boulogne.</p>

<p>In May a further move was made towards Abbeville, and a
new home was found in the Ciquier Area. Demobilisation
increased at a great pace, and by September only 155 other
ranks remained. Canteen stores were sold to another regiment,
and without canteen stores no regiment can exist.

<h2 id="Third_Battalion_Civil_Service_Rifles">3rd Battalion Civil Service Rifles<br />

<span class="medium"><span class="smcap">By Major H. Duncan Lewis</span></span></h2>

<p>The 3rd, subsequently the Reserve, Battalion, was raised in
May, 1915, for the purpose of furnishing drafts to the 1st
and 2nd Battalions. Lieutenant-Colonel R. C. Hayes, T.D.,
relinquishing the command of the 2nd Battalion, was appointed
Commanding Officer, and retained the position until he was
disabled by an unfortunate accident during a Madsen gun
demonstration on the miniature rifle range at Wimbledon in
May, 1918. He was succeeded by Lieutenant-Colonel C. M.
Mackenzie, D.S.O., who commanded the 2nd Battalion of the
Kensingtons in France and Palestine. Lieutenant-Colonel
Mackenzie remained with the Battalion until it was broken up
shortly after the Armistice, when he was appointed Commandant
of the Demobilisation Camp at Wimbledon.</p>

<p>The men were at first billeted at their homes and assembled
daily at Somerset House for preliminary organisation, drill and
route marching.</p>

<h3>Richmond Park.</h3>

<p>After a short period the Battalion went into camp at Richmond
Park with other third-line units of the 1st and 2nd London
T.F. Divisions, under Brigadier-General C. S. O. Monck. Living
together in camp made it possible to commence instilling into
the men that sense of military discipline which is the first
qualification of a soldier, and progress in this direction soon
became apparent. At first the training was necessarily on
somewhat elementary lines owing to various causes, such as
the want of experienced officers and N.C.O.’s, lack of arms and
equipment, etc., but in the course of time, as these disabilities
became gradually less and the syllabus of training more
systematised, there followed marked improvement.</p>

<p>An early difficulty felt by the Commanding Officer was in
regard to senior officers. A number of smart and promising
junior officers had been posted to the Battalion, many of whom
later on served with distinction at the Front, both in France and
Palestine, but at the time they were new to military duties.
This difficulty was met to a great extent by the transfer, first, of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
Major G. W. Turk from the 101st Provisional Battalion, and
shortly afterwards, of Major H. D. Lewis from the 2nd Battalion.
In August, 1915, when the latter officer was transferred, the
organisation of the Battalion consisted of two companies of
six strong platoons each.</p>

<p>Captain C. J. Bowen was gazetted as Adjutant, which post he
held until August, 1917, when he was seconded for service in
East Africa. He was succeeded in turn by Captains R. F.
Guyton, W. L. C. Rathbone, M.C., A.M., and F. C. Olliff. The
important post of Quartermaster was filled by the appointment
of Captain W. G. Hodge, late Quartermaster-Sergeant of the 2nd
Battalion, and, except for a period of ten months, when he
exchanged duties with Captain A. Toomey, of the 1st Battalion,
he remained with the Battalion until the end. It is difficult to
overestimate his services: his untiring zeal and efficiency,
combined with firmness and tact, have given him a place in the
front rank of those officers who have served the Regiment in a
similar capacity. He was ably assisted by Regimental Quartermaster-Sergeant
J. S. McIntyre, until the latter went overseas
early in 1918.</p>

<p>The Battalion was very fortunate in its Medical Officer, Captain
F. M. Hughes. He endeared himself to all ranks by his kindly
interest in, and attention to, all his patients, and when he left for
France the whole Battalion turned out to give him a send off.
Every one learnt with gratification that he was the recipient
later of the Legion of Honour for gallant conduct.</p>

<p>Sergeant-Major G. Weaver was appointed Regimental
Sergeant-Major, and was succeeded in 1917 by Sergeant-Major
B. J. Jolliffe, from the 1st Battalion.</p>

<p>Barnes.</p>

<p>The Battalion remained under canvas in Richmond Park until
the 20th November&mdash;the last few weeks under trying conditions
of cold and wet&mdash;and was then transferred to billets in Barnes.
Here training was continued for six weeks under the disadvantages
consequent upon the separation of the men at the close
of each day’s work.</p>

<p>Hazeley Down.</p>

<p>Early in January, 1916, the Battalion was moved to Hazeley
Down, 3&frac12; miles to the south of Winchester, where a camp of
considerable size was formed, consisting mainly of third-line
units of the 2nd London T.F. Divisions, including at first the
Kensingtons and the Queen’s Westminsters and later, when
these two Battalions left, the London Scottish&mdash;the three other
Battalions of the 4th Reserve London Brigade.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span></p>

<p>The camp was situated in an ideal position on the southern
slope of one of the many downs in the neighbourhood: with
stretches of well-wooded country, intersected by good roads, it
formed altogether a most suitable region for military training.
There was a range close by, at Chilcomb; there were trenches on
Fawley Down, about a mile away, and at the camp there was
plenty of space for digging, and bombing, and assault courses,
as well as a good miniature range.</p>

<p>For two years&mdash;the greater part of its life&mdash;the Battalion
made its home at this camp, and from here draft after draft was
sent out, mainly to the 1st, partly to the 2nd Battalion, and
occasionally to other units at the respective Fronts. The drafts
had been trained, thanks very largely to the efforts of the disabled
officers and N.C.O.’s from Overseas, as far as possible in the
limited time at disposal.</p>

<p>When leave was given at the beginning of 1917 to enrol boys
of 18, the strength of the Battalion mounted rapidly, and for
some months stood at a total of about 2,400. These lads were
of an excellent type, and as it was possible to give them a much
longer training than the other recruits, they became quite good
soldiers and many of them proved suitable for, and were given,
commissions. Under the special recruiting system, admirably
worked by Lieutenant C. E. Doubleday, Officer Commanding
Depot, the ranks of the Battalion were reinforced by much the
same class of man as joined the Regiment in pre-war days. When
that system ceased, in 1918, the Battalion had to accept whatever
men were sent to it by the Recruiting Officer, but particular pains
were taken, and with great success, to imbue them with a sense
of the best traditions of the Regiment. Indeed, throughout its
career, whether on or off duty, both in billets and in camp, the
conduct of the Battalion was worthy of the regimental badge.</p>

<p>While at Hazeley the Battalion was organised in six
companies as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A.” Major G. W. Turk.</p>

<p>“B.” Major H. D. Lewis.</p>

<p>“C” and “D.” Various officers, mostly from Overseas,
amongst others: Majors F. M. Warne and E. W. Neales,
Captains A. C. Bull, L. D. Eccles, D. H. Miall, W. L. C.
Rathbone, M.C., A.M.</p>

<p>“E.” Captain G. H. Stone.</p>

<p>“F.” (Men from Overseas.) Various officers from Overseas.</p>

<p>Attached to “B” Company were Machine Gun and Signalling
Detachments under the command of Lieutenants A. E. Smith
and O. H. Mattison, respectively.</p>

<p>The gradually increasing number of experienced officers and
N.C.O.’s returning from Overseas, either from partial disablement
or for periods of rest, rendered most valuable service by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
furnishing the Battalion with instructors in all branches of
training. Exceptionally good was the work of the Musketry
Staff, in charge, successively, of Captain H. A. Berry, Lieutenants
J. A. G. Falkner and C. S. McKay; and of the Physical Exercises
Staff, under Captain H. G. Edney.</p>

<p>As regards messing, the men were well looked after, as was
always the case in the regiment, which has been particularly
fortunate in its Quartermasters. The food was good and varied,
and the arrangements generally were on several occasions the
subject of most favourable comment on the part of Inspecting
Officers. Sergeant T. V. Weaver rendered valuable service with
this work.</p>

<p>The Regimental Institute, which had been started in Richmond
Park, with Major H. D. Lewis as P.R.I., was much
developed at Hazeley and, as there were plenty of funds forthcoming
from the rebate on the canteen money, everything was
done to make the Institute attractive. The G.O.C. Southern
District, on the occasion of a visit to it in 1917, said that it was
one of the best he had seen in the command. Liberal grants
were made for the purpose of adding to the men’s comfort and
towards meeting the expenditure on games and sports.</p>

<p>Shortly before leaving Richmond permission had been given
to form a band, subject to the proviso that fit men were not
withheld from draft, and while at Barnes and during the first
year at Hazeley the Battalion possessed a really good Brass
Band; but as the men composing it were gradually dispersed,
its place was taken by quite a fair drum and fife band.</p>

<p>Close touch was kept with the 1st Battalion in France, and
while at Hazeley visits which were much appreciated in the
Battalion were paid by Lieutenant-Colonel W. H. E. Segrave,
D.S.O., and by the late Major F. W. Parish, D.S.O., M.C., both
of whom had endeared themselves to the Regiment.</p>

<p>Wimbledon.</p>

<p>On Saturday, December 22nd, 1917, the Battalion said good-bye
to Hazeley Down, and entrained for Wimbledon, where it
went into camp with the third-line units of the Queen’s Westminsters
and the 17th London, and where it remained until
disbanded at the end of 1918.</p>

<p>Here the work of training was carried on as earnestly as at
Hazeley, varied with occasional air-raid alarms, culminating in
that of Whit-Sunday.</p>

<p>In May, 1918, occurred the serious accident to Colonel Hayes,
which caused his retirement from the command, and about the
same time another change also took place. Brigadier-General
H. P. Burn, C.M.G., D.S.O., of the Gordon Highlanders, from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
famous 51st Highland Division, succeeded Brigadier-General
C. S. O. Monck in command of the Brigade.</p>

<p>In October, Major H. D. Lewis was appointed Officer Commanding
Depot, and was followed in the command of “B”
Company by Lieutenant L. C. Morris, M.C., a young officer, who
distinguished himself while in command of a Company of the
1st Battalion in the fighting at Bourlon Wood.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Armistice the Battalion was broken up, most
of the men not due for demobilisation being transferred to the
6th London Regiment at Blackdown, and the officers to the 9th
London, also in the Aldershot Command.</p>

<p>The number of recruits that passed through the 3rd Battalion
was approximately 6,000.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span></p>

<p>Regimental Aid Fund.</p>

<p>In July, 1916, Sir John Lithiby, a former member of the
Regiment, inaugurated a Fund with the object of providing
comforts for the men at the front, food and other necessaries
for the prisoners of war, and temporary help, where needed,
for the widows and dependents of men killed.</p>

<p>An influential Committee, representative of almost all the
Government Departments, was formed; with an Executive
Committee, consisting of past and present Officers of the Regiment,
with Sir H. J. Gibson, K.C.B., as Chairman, and Sir John
Lithiby as Honorary Secretary.</p>

<p>The appeal for subscriptions met with a ready response. &pound;2,850
was received for the general objects of the Fund, chiefly from the
Public Offices and the Officers and men of the Regiment; while
a further &pound;5,000 was subscribed for the prisoners of war, by the
Regiment, the Public Departments, the Central Prisoners of War
Committee, and the relatives and friends of the men themselves.</p>

<p>The comforts most appreciated by the Battalions overseas
seemed to be luxuries wherewith to supplement the ordinary
rations, and consignments of various kinds were, from time to
time, sent out from home both to France and Palestine. In
addition, the Commanding Officers were supplied with funds to
use at their discretion in brightening the sombre monotony of
trench life whenever opportunity offered.</p>

<p>The appeals from widows and dependents were fewer than
had been expected, but many necessitous cases were helped in
a quiet and unobtrusive way.</p>

<p>The chief activities of the Fund were connected with the care
of the prisoners of war, of whom there were about 210 at the date of
the Armistice, scattered throughout the various prison camps in
Germany and Palestine. Each man was provided at intervals with
a complete outfit of clothing, and three food parcels with bread,
tobacco and cigarettes were sent to him every fortnight. This
work was carried out at the Depot under the direction of the Officer
Commanding, Captain C. E. Doubleday. Most of the parcels
reached their destination safely, and the men, on their return after
the Armistice, expressed great appreciation of what had been done
for them. Only a few, happily, had to complain of exceptionally
harsh treatment at the hands of their German captors.</p>

<p>In accordance with its rules the Aid Fund was closed early
in 1921, and the General Committee, with the approval of the
Charity Commissioners, disposed of the unexpended balance of
&pound;1,929, by presenting &pound;1,500 to the Old Comrades’ Association,
and the remainder to the Officer Commanding the Regiment to
be applied to the erection of a Memorial to the officers and men
who had fallen during the War.</p>

<span class="medium">THE RECONSTITUTED BATTALION</span></h2>

<p>The first step towards securing the future of the Battalion may
be said to have been taken when friends of the Regiment in
1918 approached authority with a view to the Prince of Wales
assuming the Honorary Colonelcy, so long held by his grandfather,
but it had been considered advisable to wait the termination
of hostilities. In 1919, however, a letter was received from
the Controller to his Royal Highness, stating that the Prince of
Wales would accept the position. The appointment which
followed in due course was received with unbounded delight
in the Regiment.</p>

<p>Many months of delay on the part of the Army Council in
forming their post-war policy in regard to the Territorial Force
had a most deleterious effect, and thus when the task of reconstituting
the Regiment was commenced many difficulties
were experienced, the bands of comradeship had loosened, and
there was a marked disinclination among the greater part of
those who had worn khaki for so long in war to put it on again
in peace, whilst the absence of a “young entry” into H.M.
Civil Service destroyed our main source of recruits.</p>

<p>The command of the Regiment was offered to Major Viscount
Bury, M.C., Special Reserve Scots Guards, who accepted and
was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel in February, 1920. He
was thus the third of his name to have the honour of commanding
the Regiment. A letter was received on behalf of Lord Grenfell,
Colonel of the King’s Royal Rifle Corps, pointing out that
during the war the Civil Service Rifles, among other battalions,
had been affiliated by Army Council instructions to the regiment
of which he was Chief, and requesting that the feeling of the
Regiment as to the continuance of the connection should be
made known to him in reply. Answer was accordingly made
that though the Regiment highly appreciated the honour of
having been linked to the tradition of so distinguished a Corps,
yet they now felt that they would like to stand on the merits
of their war record rather than to shelter under the magnificent
reputation in the making of which they had not taken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
part. It was added that the Regiment had for years carried out
line drill and had only for a short period drilled as riflemen.</p>

<p>The Commanding Officer was fortunate in securing as
Adjutant, Captain (Brevet Major) W. H. Ramsbotham of the
West Yorkshire Regiment (Prince of Wales’s Own). He also
applied successfully to the Coldstream Guards for a Regimental
Sergeant-Major in the person of C.S.M. Stevens, D.C.M., and
later, through the instrumentality of General Jeffreys, two
Sergeant Instructors were obtained from the same regiment.
Captain A. A. Joslin was appointed Quartermaster, a position
he held in the Second Battalion throughout the war. Captain
A. E. Evans, R.A.M.C., who had served in that capacity with
the 1st Battalion in France, was appointed Medical Officer.
The following Officers and N.C.O.’s were appointed to the
various companies:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">“A” Company.&mdash;Major H. F. M. Warne, Captain G. E.
Thompson, D.S.O., Lieutenant F. W. Hounsell, C.S.M.
Hyder, C.Q.M.S. Lewis, M.M.</p>

<p class="hang">“B” Company.&mdash;Captain R. J. S. Gold, Captain P. Davenport,
M.C., Lieutenants S. A. Seys, M.C., J. L. Hutchison, M.C.,
C.S.M. Torbell, C.Q.M.S. F. Trout.</p>

<p class="hang">“C” Company.&mdash;Captain L. D. Eccles, Captain H. M. Blomfield,
(from 5th Buffs), Lieutenant P. E. Beddow, Second-Lieutenant
J. S. Oldcorn, D.C.M., C.Q.M.S. Ibbett, M.M., and Sergeant
(A/C.S.M.) A. C. Ridlington, M.C.</p>

<p class="hang">“D” Company.&mdash;Captain T. N. Sharratt, Lieutenant W. D.
Hooper, Lieutenant P. H. Hall, C.S.M. Callingham, C.Q.M.S. Sale.</p></blockquote>

<p>Recruiting started slowly and by midsummer some eighty
members had joined, to which number was added the Band of
twenty-four members, under Band-Sergeant H. W. Blackmore.
The Band had all served in this capacity on the Western Front
with the 1st Battalion.</p>

<p>It was felt that there was no better way of influencing
recruiting than by reviving the Annual Midsummer Camp.
This battalion, alone of the 2nd London Division, was fortunate
in obtaining leave for this, and a contingent of the Regiment,
under command of Major Warne, spent a happy fortnight at
St. Martin’s Plain, Shorncliffe. R.S.M. Stevens at this camp
earned the commendation of the G.O.C. London District,
General Jeffreys, for the remarkable progress made by recruits
under his zealous teaching.</p>

<p>After camp recruiting began to quicken in pace. The
Sergeants’ Mess was re-established. The custom of holding two
yearly dinners of the Officers’ Mess had been revived, and the
first of these was held in November. Among the guests was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
the newly-appointed Commander of the 4th (Grey) London
Infantry Brigade, Colonel F. G. Lewis. Subsequently, H.R.H.
the Prince of Wales was approached and he honoured the Regiment
by attending the Mess Dinner held in the Alexandra Room
of the Trocadero on the 4th April, 1921. There were also present
Sir Warren Fisher, K.C.B. (Secretary to Treasury); Sir Henry
Gibson (Auditor-General); Major-General Jeffreys (G.O.C.
London District); Sir Neville Smyth, V.C. (G.O.C. 47th (2nd
London) Division); Colonel F. G. Lewis, Holland Martin, Esq.,
C.B.E. (Chairman County of London Territorial Force Association);
and many old commanding officers of the Regiment,
including Colonel A. M. Renny, Lieutenant-Colonel Segrave,
Lieutenant-Colonel R. Fielding, Lieutenant-Colonel W. F. K.
Newson, Lieutenant-Colonel A. W. Gaze, Colonel R. G. Hayes,
T.D., Major A. C. H. Benk&eacute;, Sir John Lithiby and Sir Charles
Walker, K.C.B.</p>

<p>A third dinner, held in November, 1921, at the Civil Service
Rifles’ Club, was honoured by the attendance of Lieutenant-General
Sir Francis Lloyd, G.C.V.O., who in an admirable
speech gave encouragement to those who are working hard for
the continued existence and future of their Regiment.</p>

<p>During the time which had elapsed since the Armistice, the
activities of the Regiment had been kept well in the public
view. The Regiment had taken part in the processional march
of the London troops in 1919, when the representatives of the
1st and 2nd Battalions were led respectively by Lieutenant-Colonel
Feilding and Lieutenant-Colonel Gaze; at the unveiling
by the Duke of York of the memorial to London troops erected
in front of the Royal Exchange, and on the occasion of the
presentation of colours to battalions of the 56th Division at
the Horse Guards’ Parade by H.R.H. Princess Mary it had
helped, in company with other troops of the 47th Division, to
line the parade ground. The Regiment also sent detachments
to the unveiling of the memorial to King Edward VII, and also
to the unveiling of the memorial to those men of the Post
Office (many of whom served in the Regiment) who fell in the
late war.</p>

<p>At Easter, 1921, the pre-war custom of a visit to the Guards
Depot at Caterham was revived, and over 100 other ranks received
the traditional hospitality and welcome from all ranks of the
Depot. This was a great success and had much influence on
recruiting. After this camp great efforts were made by members
of the Regiment, and the effects were just beginning to be
shown, when an event disastrous to the Regiment, as far as
recruiting was concerned, occurred. For the month previous to
April, 1921, recruits had been coming in at the rate of twelve to
fifteen per week, and had that rate of increase been maintained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
a satisfactory increase of strength would have been seen by
midsummer. In April, 1921, the Defence Force was formed.
Members of H.M. Civil Service were forbidden to join. The
Headquarters Staff were taken away and Headquarters given
up to a force which had nothing in common with the Regiment.
With the exception of shooting, all its activities were suspended.
For over three months this state of affairs continued and had a
blighting effect on the regimental prosperity. The other regiments
of the Division on the disbandment of the Defence Force
secured a large number of recruits from those who had served in
the Defence Unit bearing their names, whilst the Civil Service
Rifles, through no fault of their own, lost not only those who
would have joined had not the Defence Force been formed, but
received merely a few individuals as recruits from among all
those who had enlisted in the Defence Force. In spite of these
difficulties the task was resumed. The Regimental Shooting
Programme, seriously curtailed, was carried out, while in July,
1921, at the first post-war camp of the Grey Brigade at Shorncliffe,
over 200 other ranks attended. The Regiment there
maintained its reputation for efficiency, and the Battalion
signallers under Sergeant Maddocks earned commendation by
the Inspecting Officer of being the best trained signallers in the
Division, whilst the band by their excellent performances on the
Leas at Folkestone and in Camp brought themselves into deserved
prominence.</p>

<p>In the world of sport the Battalion team reached the semi-final
of the Divisional Football Championship, whilst the Civil Service
Rifles Harriers gained second place in the Cross Country
Championship. The season’s shooting at Bisley was crowned
by winning the Middlesex Cup on 10th September, 1921; this
cup conferring the primacy for the year on the Regimental team
over those from all Territorial units in the six Home Counties.
Relative to the winning of this Trophy a letter was received from
the Secretary to the Prince of Wales expressing his Royal
Highness’s pleasure. Accompanying the letter was a large
signed photograph of H.R.H., which, sent as it was on the eve
of the departure of H.R.H. on his visit to India gave to all ranks
highest gratification as evidence of the support and interest felt
for his own Civil Service Rifles by the Prince of Wales.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
